Madam Speaker, 
 
Honourable Members, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  I am pleased to welcome you to the First Sitting of 2015 of the First Session of the 

Sixth National Assembly of Mauritius being held today the 27th of January.  
 

2.  It  is  my  honour  and  privilege  to  welcome  Hon.  Sir  Anerood  Jugnauth,  GCSK, 
KCMG,  QC,  as  the  new  Prime  Minister  and  Leader  of  the  House,  Hon.  Ravi 
Yerrigadoo as Attorney General and Mrs Santi Bai Hanoomanjee as Speaker of 
this Assembly. 

 

3.  I bid a special welcome to all the newly elected members whom I wish a fruitful 

journey at the service of the nation.  

4.  On  the10th  of  December  2014,  the  population  overwhelmingly  and  very  clearly 
expressed its faith and trust in Sir Anerood Jugnauth, his coalition partners and his 
team to bring meaningful change to the daily life of our people and to lead them 
towards happiness, prosperity and a better future. 

5.  Respecting the will of the nation, Government will govern for the People with the 
People. And this pledge will consistently drive the endeavours and actions of all 
Ministers throughout this mandate.  

 
6.  Government’s  objective  is  to  transform  Mauritius  into  a  truly  forward  looking, 
environmentally  sustainable,  economically  vibrant  and  innovative  country  with 
modern infrastructure, global connectivity, high skills and technology. 

7.  Government will improve quality of life, accelerate social integration, strengthen 
democracy  and  ensure  the  independent  functioning  of  institutions.  The  ultimate 
aim is to shape a second socio-economic miracle in the interest of one and all. 

8.  Government is committed to conducting business on the principles of discipline, 

transparency, accountability and exemplary governance.  

9.  This implies: 

wastage; 

and corruption; 

meritocracy; 

•  Responsible  and  judicious  use  of  public  funds  and  a  crusade  to  weed  out 

•  An  open  and  transparent  bidding  and  procurement  process  to  combat  fraud 

•  A transparent and merit-based recruitment and appointment policy to ensure 

•  An  in-depth  reform  of  our  public  sector  institutions  to  inject  productivity, 

efficiency and quality service; 

•  A zero tolerance policy against crime and violence; 
•  Freeing  our  society  from  the  shackles  of  widespread  corruption,  favoritism, 

nepotism, mafias and political interference, and 

10 

•  Guaranteeing access to information and broadening of the democratic space. 

10. Government is committed to warding off unemployment, introducing a minimum 

wage policy and implementing a better social housing policy.  

11.  Government will lay the foundations of a stronger economy and a fairer society. 
The aim is to promote a healthy business climate that will encourage enterprise 
and  investment  and,  at  the  same  time,  ensure  happiness  and  prosperity  to  our 
people and a greater sense of belonging to the nation.  

12.  Government  adheres  to  the  principle  that  in  the  development  process  and 
financial  advancement,  national  wealth  must  be  equitably  distributed.  The 
philosophy of ‘développement à visage humain et chances égales pour tous’ shall 
eminently prevail in all our endeavours. 

13. Government  is  convinced  that  sustainable  economic  growth  cannot  be  achieved 

without the integration and participation of the entire population.  

14.  Consequently, a key consideration of Government during its mandate will be to 
reduce the  gap between  the rich and the poor, promote social justice, economic 
empowerment and national unity, and protect the elderly and vulnerable ones.   

 

 

 

 

 

Honourable Members, 
 
SOCIAL INCLUSION 

 

 

 

 
15.  Meaningful  change  starts  with  a  strong  focus  on  the  most  vulnerable  citizens. 
Only  a  few  days  after  being  sworn  into  power,  Government  granted  a  sizeable 
increase in pension payments to the elderly, as  well as to the widows, orphans, 
physically handicapped and all other recipients of social aid.   
 

16.  Thus,  the  monthly  old  age  pension,  basic  widow’s  pension  and  basic  invalid 
pension have all been increased to Rs5,000. At the same time, a uniform salary 
compensation of Rs600 has been granted to all workers and employees.  

17.  A minimum wage bill will be introduced for the workers at the lower end of the 

ladder. 

18. To further alleviate people’s financial burden, government will eliminate VAT on 

a number of food products. 

 
19.  Government  will  set  up  a  special  financial  assistance  scheme  to  help  students 
from modest families to pursue tertiary education and thus contribute to their own 
economic and social advancement. 

20. A medium to long term Marshall Plan will be elaborated to combat poverty and 
social exclusion. The National Empowerment Foundation will be restructured to 
render it more proactive and improve service delivery to the poor. 

 

 

11 

21. New legislation will be brought forward to provide more protection and security 
to  the  elderly,  women,  children  and  physically  handicapped.  Penalties  for 
offenders will be substantially increased.  

 
22.  Government will set up additional recreation and activity facility centres for the 

elderly and the disabled. 

 
23.  Government  will  further  strengthen  the  existing  legislations  in  respect  of 
charitable  institutions  which  will  be  required  to  install  CCTV  cameras  on  their 
premises,  ensure  the  presence  of  a  full-time  medical  practitioner  and  recruit 
qualified and trained carers, as well as a psychologist. 

 
24. Government will provide special support care to elderly persons with disabilities 
and those living alone as part of its strategy to provide a ‘service de proximité’ to 
them. 

 
25. Government proposes to amend sections 3 and 16 of the Constitution to prohibit 
discrimination  and  introduce  a  Disability  Bill  to  provide  further  protection  to 
persons with disabilities. 

 
26.  Government  will  review  the  national  pensions  fund  to  strengthen  enforcement 

and sustainability and ensure adequate income replacement. 

27.  Government  will  increase  housing  supply  and  home  ownership  for  the 
economically and socially disadvantaged. The construction of some 10,000 social 
housing units during this present mandate has been planned. 

28.  To protect financially distressed people, legislation will be enacted to prohibit, for 
a period of two years, the sale by levy of the only house of a worker who has been 
made redundant on economic grounds. In the same vein, the overall procedure of 
sale by levy will be reviewed to prevent collusion between financial institutions, 
legal advisors and their agents. 

29.  A new strategic land use planning framework will be developed to achieve major 

social and development objectives. 

 
30. Over the next five years, a significant number of jobs will be created in the public 
sector.  In  parallel,  the  private  sector  will  be  empowered  through  various  fiscal 
measures  to  actively  participate  in  government’s  unemployment  alleviation 
mission.   

 
31.  Some  15,000  jobs  will  thus  be  created  annually.  A  new  dynamism  will  be 
instilled  in  the  existing  economic  sectors  and,  later  on,  from  new  development

poles, such as regional bunkering hub, the ocean economy, duty-free shopping and 
the ICT enabled services sectors. 

 
32. Labour legislation will be amended to better protect employees.  

33.  A new school of nursing will be opened in the south of the country and a project 
to  train  and  prepare  medical  staff  for  employment  abroad  will  be  initiated. 
Bilateral agreements and partnerships will be sought with other countries to that 
end.  

34. A considerable number of well-remunerated seasonal jobs will be created in the 
cruise, shipping and hospitality sectors. The recruitment and training exercise will 
be carried out in an open and transparent way under the aegis of the government. 

35. To  increase  the  chances  of  young  jobseekers  and  fresh  graduates  secure 
permanent  employment  at  their  training  stations,  the  duration  of  the  state 
subsidised  Youth  Employment  Programme  will  be  extended  to  two  years.  
Prospective employers will thus have additional time to assess their trainees. 

36. The  Youth  Employment  Programme  will  be  reviewed  in  order  to  extend  the 

duration of the contract of employment to a period of two years.   

37. New  fiscal  incentives  will  be  granted  to  the  private  sector  to  encourage  them 

recruit unemployed people on a full-time basis. 

38. In order to increase the  employability of people  convicted of minor  crimes and 
misdemeanours,  such  records  will  cease  to  appear  on  their  ‘certificates  of 
character’ after a period of one year.  

39. To encourage companies hire local work force,  work permit regulations will be 
reviewed.  Recruitment  of  foreigners  will  be  limited  to  scarcity  areas  and  to 
acquire new skills.  

40.  A  new  national  employment  agency  will  be  created  to  find  suitable  job 

placements for the unemployed. 

 
41. The Back to Work Programme will be implemented to facilitate women wishing 

to take up or resume employment. 

 
42. Amendments  will  be  brought  to  the  Employment  Rights  Act  with  a  view  to 
extending maternity leave from 12 to 14 weeks to better support working mothers 
fulfill their family obligations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

YOUTH & SPORTS 
 

43.   Government will endeavour to increase the level and standard of sports activities 
in  the  country.  Professional  football  will  be  actively  promoted.  In  collaboration

with an English premier league soccer club, a high-level football academy will be 
set up in Mauritius to offer talented youngsters the opportunity to pursue a career 
locally and abroad. 

 
44.  To provide greater access to quality and user friendly services to the young and 
empowering them to better participate in the socio-economic development of the 
country, Government will review the operations of youth centres.  

45.  New  modern  residential  sports  training  centres  will  be  built  in  Bel  Ombre  and 

Anse La Raie.  

46.  A National Youth Volunteer Scheme will be introduced to promote volunteering 

culture among the youth.  

47.  Government will set up fitness facilities in sports complexes and youth centres to 

encourage regular physical exercises. 

48.  Government will strengthen legislation on women, children, community care and 

49.  A new Children’s Bill will be introduced to bring together the different pieces of 

legislation dealing with children under one single legislative umbrella.  

50.  A new Bill will be introduced to replace the National Women’s Council Act of 
1985  to  provide  for  a  more  dynamic,  productive  and  structured  council.    Laws 
relating  to  protection  and  prevention  of  domestic  violence  will  be  reinforced. 
Particular attention will be given to street children. 

51. The SILWF Act will be reviewed to meet the changing needs and aspirations of 

 
52.  Sustainable  and  eco-friendly  development  ranks  high  on  Government’s  agenda 

and is expected to pave the way for a cleaner, greener and safer Mauritius. 

53.  The Beach Authority Act will be reviewed and Beach Management Plans will be 
developed  and  implemented  to  ensure  a  more  rational  development  and 
sustainable use of beaches. Reinforcing safety and security on public beaches will 
be a key priority. 

54.  Government will take necessary steps to ensure that beachfronts, public beaches 
and access to the sea remain the domain of the public. Commercial developments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

in  these  places  will  be  carefully  weighed  against  the  population’s  need  for 
recreational activities.  

55.  Government  will  ensure  that  lease  hold  rights  of  Pas  Géometriques  and  other 
state  lands  are  not  transferred,  sold  or  otherwise  monetised  in  whatever  form 
without prior authorisation of the Cabinet.  

56. Efforts  will  be  made  to  reclaim  back  all  leases  that  have  not  respected  the 
development  clause  for  which  they  were  allocated,  or  which  are  being  held  for 
speculative or pecuniary motives.   

 
57.  The Environment Protection Act will be reviewed to more effectively respond to 
the  changing  needs  of  the  day  and  tackle  emerging  challenges  including 
mitigation concepts. 

58.  The  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC)  will  be  revived  to  create  better 
synergy  among  the  various  stakeholders  to  address  important  environmental 
concerns and issues. 

59.  For more efficient prevention and control of environmental pollution, the Police 
de l’Environnement will be strengthened and reinforced and the various enforcing 
agencies empowered. 

60.  Addressing  climate  change  is  a  major  challenge,  particularly  for  Small  Island 
Developing  States.  In  this  context,  Government  will  come  up  with  a  Climate 
Change Bill and a new Climate Change Mitigation Strategy and Action Plan will 
be devised and implemented. 

61.  To  enhance  the  safety  and  security  of  our  citizens  against  natural  disasters, 
Government  will  review  and  update  the  national  multi-hazard  early  warning 
system  and  embark  on  innovative  disaster  management  education,  training  and 
public awareness initiatives. 

62.  Government  will  adopt  a  responsible  and  environmentally  sustainable  policy 
regarding  energy  production,  waste  management  and  physical  infrastructural 
development. Awareness, control, monitoring and sanctions will be at the heart of 
future initiatives.  

63.  Fiscal incentives will be provided to encourage renewable energy production.  

 

EDUCATION 
 

64.  Government will aim to deliver a high standard of academic education and skills 
for  our  youngsters.  Education  reforms  will  focus  on  curriculum  review  and 
performance improvement at all levels.  Remedial education at an early stage of 
the primary and secondary education cycles will remain a priority in order to deal 
with learning deficits, early drop-outs and failures.   

15 

65.  Government  will  introduce  a  nine-year  basic  continuous  schooling  and  the 
Certificate  of  Primary  Education  (CPE)  will  be  replaced  by  an  end-of-primary 
cycle assessment.  

66. To  alleviate  financial  burden,  improve  education  attainment  and  child  health, 
Government  will ensure that all pupils  attending primary schools receive a  free 
hot meal.  

 
67. Full subsidies on SC and HSC examinations will be extended indiscriminately to 

all pupils irrespective of their social background.  

 
68.  Government will introduce environmental awareness and value-based education 

69. A School of Arts will be set up to promote holistic learner development in areas of 

in the primary education curriculum. 

music, dance, painting and drama. 

70.  In  order  to  build  on  the  existing  partnership  with  the  private  providers  of 
secondary  education  and  make  it  more  effective,  Government  will  review  the 
Private Secondary Schools Authority (PSSA) Act. 

71.  Government  will  reinforce  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training 
(TVET)  and  provide  for  a  new  legal  framework  to  govern  the  sub-sector, 
including  the  review  of  the  Mauritius  Institute  of  Training  and  Development 
(MITD). 

72.  The  MITD  will  be  called  upon  to  position  itself  as  a  Regional  Training  of 
Trainers Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in Southern 
and Eastern African, COMESA and SADC countries. 

73.  Government  will  introduce  a  Skills  for  Growth  scheme  that  will  offer 
opportunities  to  young  graduates  to  acquire  work  experience  and  to  put  into 
practice  their  knowledge,  thereby  assisting  SMEs  in  terms  of  manpower, 
knowledge-sharing, creativity and innovation. 

74.  With a view to providing students with relevant career guidance and counselling 
services,  an  Integrated  Career  Counselling  System  including  career  orientation, 
information and management services will be established. 

75.  Government will introduce a ‘Chambre des Métiers’ Bill to give due recognition 
to  the  various  professions,  including  the  registration  of  people  in  the  different 
trades, setting standards for training facilities and qualifications in each trade. 

 
76.  A  Higher  Education  Bill  will  be  introduced  as  a  new  legal  framework  for  the 
development  of  quality  education  and  research  in  line  with  the  objective  of 
strengthening  Mauritius  as  a  knowledge  hub.  In  the  same  vein,  the  Tertiary 
Education Act will be reviewed and the TEC strengthened as the regulator. 

77.  With  a  view  to  providing  higher  learning  opportunities  for  those  in  need  of 
fostering  greater  equity  in  the  system,  Government  will  encourage  access  to 
Tertiary  Education  for  students  from  low  income  families  and  students  with 
disabilities.

Honourable Members,

the national cake are fundamental elements in achieving meaningful change.    

 
176. Inspired by the first economic miracle that took our country out of the doldrums 
in  the  eighties,  Government  will  steer  the  economy  to  a  much  higher  plane  of 
development. New policies will be implemented to boost GDP growth and create 
jobs.

of  a  regional  bunkering  hub,  the  development  of  the  ocean  economy,  the 
implementation of the duty-free shopping paradise initiative and the ICT Enabled 
Services sectors.   

178. Government  will  also  consolidate  traditional  sectors  –  sugar  cane  industry, 
tourism  and  manufacturing  -  and  existing  service  sectors,  namely  the  financial 
services industry and promote the expansion of business in Africa.   

179. Innovation will be a key driver of growth. In that context, a techno park will be 
set up to create the right environment for carrying out new research, clinical and 
innovation activities.  

180. Government  will  also  take  strong  actions  to  revitalise  private  investment  in 
existing pillars of the economy with an emphasis on greater business facilitation 
and improvement of the investment climate.    

181. Government  will  revisit and  unlock  several  investment  projects  that  have  been 
stuck  in  the  pipeline  for  too  long.    These  projects  will  be  executed  on  a  joint 
venture  basis  with  the  participation  of  local  private  sector  and  international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

investors.   This new approach will instil  a new confidence factor in the whole 
business community.   

182. The most critical success factor to the shaping of the second miracle will be the 
emergence of the new breed of young entrepreneurs and rise of the SME sector as 
the main engine of growth.   

183. To  democratise  the  economy,  Government  will  ensure  that  SMEs  become  the 

backbone of the economy in the years to come.  

184. A  new  SME  bank  will  be  set  up  and  some  Rs10  billion  earmarked  by

system and promote transparency and good governance.

declining  trend  in  order  to  achieve  the  statutory  requirement  of  50  per  cent  by 
2018.   

193. Government  will  revisit  the  Public  Procurement  Act  so  that  projects  are 
implemented faster, more efficiently, with  greater transparency and better value 
for money.    

194. Government  will  be  merciless  in  combating  the  growing  illicit  gambling 
activities  in  order  to  minimise  harm  to  society.    To  this  end,  the  Gambling 
Regulatory  Authority  Act  as  well  as  the  institutional  framework  will  be 
strengthened.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26

“Assise  du  Tourisme”  with  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  will  also  be

Government’s vision of offering a unique tourism experience in a safe and secure 
destination.

tourism and grey tourism.

tourism industry with well-defined criteria for operational standards.   

201. Regional 

tourism  will  occupy  a  predominant  position 

in  our  market 
diversification strategy. An Africa Strategy, targeting African countries registering 
sustained growth, will be implemented to capture a greater share of the African 
outbound tourists.  

202. The  tourism  support  institutions  will  be  revamped  and  reorganised  to  be  more 
responsive to the needs of tourism operators.  The Mauritius Tourism Promotion 
Authority  will  be  restructured  and  provided  with  a  new  legal  and  institutional 
framework  adapted  to  a  dynamic  institution  with  a  commercial  outlook.  The 
Tourism  Authority  will  be  transformed  into  a  business  facilitator  leveraging  on 
new  technologies  to  provide  a  more  efficient  service  to  the  stakeholders  and 
reduce the costs of doing business for tourism operators. 

203. Air  Mauritius  being  the  national  airline  is  the  backbone  of  the  tourist 
development  of  the  country.    Government  will encourage  Air  Mauritius  to  take 
necessary steps to become more competitive and to sustain the tourism industry.  
To  this  end  it  will  have  to  be  restructured  to  face  global  competition  in  the 
industry.

the  day  in  all  public  institutions.  The  continued  existence  of  loss  making 
institutions will be thoroughly assessed against the contribution they make to the 
public.  

251. The public sector will be re-organised and reformed to make it more productive, 
transparent,  accountable  and  customer  friendly.  A  Public  Sector  Efficiency 
Bureau has already been set up as a department of the newly crafted Ministry of 
Financial Services, Good Governance and Institutional Reform.  

252. Government will give serious consideration to the findings and recommendations 
of  the  National  Auditors.  Ministers,  their  accounting  officers,  and  directors  of

CONCLUSION 
 
Honourable members,  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

290.  With the advent of a new Government in place, time for the much awaited change 
in the daily life of our citizens has arrived. The next five years will therefore be a 
defining era in the economic and social revival of our country.  

291.  This legislative programme is an important stage of a journey that has just begun. 
Under the leadership of  the Prime Minister, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, Government 
will create a new economic model based on a number of challenges, namely:  

fueling growth in the major sectors of the economy; 

•  putting in place a people’s government; 
• 
•  creating new pillars of development; 
•  creating new jobs for our people; 
• 

injecting good governance, transparency and accountability in government 
business; 
tackling security, law and order; 

• 
•  protecting our fragile environment and ecosystem;  
• 
•  making opportunities more equal for all our fellow countrymen, and  
• 

improving the general well-being of the population.   

fighting poverty and social exclusion;  

292.  So  our  creed  today  is  innovative  socialism,  and  all  members  of  Government 
believe passionately in this vision.  In short, the ambition is to create an economy 
where Mauritius would be a regional reference in entrepreneurship, aviation and 
tourism, shipping and logistics, technology and innovation, just to name a few.  

293.  But it will also be founded on the determination that wealth and opportunity must 
be more fairly distributed across the entire spectrum of the society. Government 

36 

wants to see an economy where not just our standard of living, but also everyone’s 
quality of life rises steadily and sustainably in harmony with the environment.  

294.  This socio-economic vision reflects Government’s belief in the Mauritian genius 
and entrepreneurship spirit, our sense of social justice and reward sharing. It is a 
vision of a modern and vibrant Mauritius. 

295.  The results of the elections of 10th December heralded a new era for meaningful 
change.  But  Sir  Anerood  Jugnauth,  his  coalition  partners  and  his  team  alone 
cannot  materialise  this  vision.  Though  they  have  the  energy,  the  ideas  and  the 
ambition to get our country back on track, they need the support and participation 
of our entire population.  

296.  Time has come to achieve meaningful change. We must turn the page as this is the 
long awaited opportunity for us all to join forces together, recreate history through 
a second socio-economic miracle and contribute to the making of a better future 
for the nation. And that includes everyone of our rainbow nation.  

297. 

If  we  join  together,  if  we  act  decisively  and  move  forward  with  optimism  and 
determination  we  can  address  the  economic,  social  and  political  problems  that 
have plagued our nation for nearly a decade. 

298.  Together,  we  can  materialise  the  change  the  country  strongly  desires  and  move 

towards growth and prosperity.  

299.  We  appeal  to  the  population  to  participate  in  our  economic  reconstruction  and 

nation-building endeavours and help materialise our vision and dreams. 

300.  We can do that, we can reshape our own destiny and the destiny of the generations 

to come.
