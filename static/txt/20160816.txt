Order read for resuming adjourned debate on the Appropriation (2016-2017) Bill 

2016 (No. XVII of 2016). 

Question again proposed. 

Madam Speaker:  Hon. Leader of the Opposition! 

(10.02 a.m.) 

Mr Bérenger: Madam Speaker, nous avons perdu une année et ce deuxième budget 

du gouvernement actuel, s’il  contient  certains  mesures intéressantes, n’est pas un budget  de 

relance  économique  et  de  création  d’emplois,  ni  de  rupture  avec  la  politique  économique 

pratiquée  jusqu’ici.    Bizin  aret  badiner.    Nous  avons  perdu  une  année  avec  le  budget  de 

l’année dernière. 

Madam  Speaker,  quand  on  se  rappelle  des  prévisions  farfelues  et  des  bluffs  de 

l’ancien  ministre  des  finances,  appuyé  par  son  premier  ministre,  c’est  du  out  of  this  world.  

Du  surréaliste!  Du  délire!  Sur  lesquels,  Madam  Speaker,  il  n’y  a  pas  lieu  de  revenir.  Pour 

cette  année,  je  commencerai  par  les  mesures  intéressantes  du  présent  budget,  mais  une 

 

 

8 

déception  d’abord.  L’éradication  –  le  mot  est  du  ministre  des  Finances  lui-même,  dans  son 

discours du budget – de la pauvreté absolue grâce à un nouveau scheme.  Laissez-moi citer le 

paragraphe 298 du discours du budget, où le ministre lui-même dit – 

“(…) I am taking an unprecedented decision to eradicate absolute poverty (…)” 

Et cela, il vise à le faire avant tout en introduisant, je cite – 

“(…) I am introducing a new scheme under which every adult on the Social Register 

will be entitled to a monthly subsistence allowance (…)” 

As from December 01, 2016. Eradicaiton of absolute poverty à travers cette mesure, en vérité, 

très importante. 

Mais,  Madame  la  présidente,  le  ministre  de  l’Intégration  sociale,  quant  à  lui,  après 

avoir  présenté  dans  les  Estimates  de  son  ministère  à  la  page  257,  Main  achievements  for 

Financial Year 2015-2016 – 

First, the Marshall Plan against poverty finalised in collaboration with the UNDP and, 

second,  the  registration  of  13,267  households  with  a  monthly  income  of  less  than  Rs6,200 

under the Social Register of Mauritius. 

Les mots utilisés par le ministre des Finances étaient absolument clairs. La nouvelle 

mesure s’appliquera à toutes ces familles. Le chiffre est donné. Mais, lorsque j’ai demandé au 

ministre de l’Intégration sociale de confirmer que ces 13,267 familles en situation de pauvreté 

bénéficieront  toutes  de  cette  nouvelle  mesure  visant  à  éradiquer  la  pauvreté  absolue,  le 

ministre de l’Intégration sociale, en réponse à ma PNQ du 4 août, a refusé de confirmer que 

toutes  ces  13,267  familles  recevraient  bien  ce  nouveau  monthly  allowance  à  partir  du  01 

décembre  2016.  Il  a  refusé  de  le  faire,  se  contentant  d’annoncer,  pour  maintenant,  un  full-

fledged  survey  pour  déterminer  le  nombre  de  familles  qui  bénéficieront  finalement  de  cette 

nouvelle  mesure.  Nous  reviendrons  bien  sûr  sur  cela,  Madam  Speaker,  de  même  que  sur  la 

mise en application du Marshall Plan against poverty. 

(Interruptions) 

Déception donc! Mais, par contre, concernant les mesures en faveur des enfants handicapés et 

de  leur  éducation,  un  grand  pas  en  avant  a  été  fait,  et  je  remercie  pour  cela  le  ministre  des 

Finances  lui-même,  bien  sûr,  mais  aussi  la  ministre  de  la  Sécurité  sociale.  Bravo !  Mais, 

évidemment, cela ne m’empêchera de surveiller de près la mise en application de ces mesures 

très positives pour les enfants handicapés et leur éducation. 

 

 

9 

Dans  le  cas  du  CSR,  Madam  Speaker,  le  ministre  des  Finances  actuel  a  hérité  du 

chaos causé l’année dernière par son prédécesseur, mais les mesures annoncées ont seulement 

ouvert un chantier sur lequel il faudra beaucoup travailler. 

Enfin,  dans  le  cas  des  petites  et  moyennes  entreprises,  après  les  bluffs  de  l’année 

dernière, tout est à refaire, et on est en droit de s’inquiéter lorsque le gouvernement compte 

surtout sur la Banque de développement (DBM) pour aider le secteur. 

Madam Speaker, à l’occasion des débats l’année dernière sur le budget, j’avais accusé 

le nouveau gouvernement de deux choses. 

Premièrement,  d’avoir  raté  l’occasion  de  prendre  un  nouveau  départ  économique, 

lorsqu’il avait sacrifié le budget de développement du gouvernement au profit du budget de 

fonctionnement. 

Deuxièmement, de ne pas tenir un langage de vérité à la population, et, au contraire, 

de promettre un miracle économique, de bluffer all the way, et de manipuler les chiffres. 

Avec  le  présent  budget,  Madam  Speaker,  il  n’y  a  pas  vraiment  de  rupture  avec  tout 

cela. Madam Speaker, répétons-le. Ce qui est le plus important pour la relance de l’économie 

et 

la  création  d’emploi,  c’est 

la  relance  de 

l’investissement.  Rappelons 

ici  que 

l’investissement privé représente trois-quarts des investissements du pays, et l’investissement 

public un quart de ces investissements. 

Le fait est que l’investissement privé est passé de 17.5% du GDP en 2012 à 12.9% en 

2015, et qu’il est prévu qu’il baisse encore en 2016. De son côté, l’investissement public est 

passé de 5.5% du GDP  en 2012 à 4.8%  en 2015. Résultat,  le  Domestic Investment Rate  est 

tombé à 18% du GDP en 2015-2016, alors que dans le budget de l’année dernière il avait été 

prévu qu’il passerait à 24.8% du GDP. 

Tous ces chiffres parlent d’eux-mêmes, Madam Speaker. Pour 2016-2017, le présent 

budget prévoit que le total public sector investment, c’est-à-dire, les investissements de l’État 

à travers le budget et ceux des corps paraétatiques et compagnies d’État, va plus que doubler 

comparé  à  2015-2016,  mais  les  chiffres  sont  over  optimistic,  comme  dans  le  passé,  et  les 

investissements publics finalement réalisés seront bien plus bas que prévu dans le budget. 

De son côté, Madam Speaker, le Foreign Direct Investment, l’investissement privé de 

l’étranger, le FDI est passé de 18 milliards en 2014 à 9.6 milliards en 2015 et devrait rester 

au-dessous de 10 milliards cette année, en 2016. 

 

 

10 

Devant  de tels  chiffres,  Madam Speaker, et  prenant  aussi  en compte le  Brexit, est-il 

réaliste  d’estimer,  comme  l’a  fait  le  ministre  des  Finances  dans  son  budget,  que  le  GDP 

growth sera de 4.1% en 2016-2017, alors que la Banque de  

Maurice elle-même estime que le GDP growth sera de 3.8% en 2017 ? Le doute est 

permis, malgré le grant, le don de l’Inde de R 13 milliards. Mais ceci dit, Madam Speaker, le 

fait est que l’Inde a sauvé le budget 2016-2017, y compris le déficit budgétaire. Le budgétaire 

2016/17  prévoit  que  le  déficit  budgétaire  sera  de  3.3%  du  GDP,  mais  si  on  le  calcule,  à  la 

IMF,  c’est-à-dire,  selon  les  normes  internationales,    ce  déficit  budgétaire  à  la  façon  de  la 

IMF, c’est-à-dire, en incluant les special funds, le déficit monte à 4.4% du GDP. Si les grants, 

si  les  dons  de  l’Inde  tardent  à  être  déboursés,  ce  déficit  budgétaire  se  rapprochera  des  5%. 

Mais,  on  peut  prévoir  en  même  temps,  et  comme  chaque  année,  un  short  for  all  dans  les 

dépenses  prévues  au  capital  spending  au  budget  de  développement  du  gouvernement,  avec 

pour  résultat,  Madam  Speaker,  que  le  déficit  budgétaire  en  2016/2017,  selon  mes  calculs, 

devrait, ou pourrait dépasser à nouveau les 4%. 

 

Quant à la dette publique, Madam Speaker, qui est déjà à 65% du  GDP, ce qui était 

unsustainable - je pense que tout le monde est d’accord là-dessus.  Il est prévu dans le budget 

que ce public debt baisse à 63% en juin 2017 et 61% en juin 2018.  Ce qui est toujours plus 

que les 60% du GDP, considéré the world over comme le danger belt’s level.  Et cette dette 

publique,  Madam  Speaker,  est  underestimated  quand  on  prend  en  considération  l’héritage 

BAI.    Et  cette  dette  publique  ne  prend  pas  non  plus  en  considération  les  milliards  de 

réclamation  déjà  en  cours  devant  différents  tribunaux  internationaux  concernant  un  gros 

projet  immobilier  au  Morne,  agréé,  ensuite  annulé  sous  l’ancien  gouvernement.    Donc, 

concernant ce gros projet immobilier au Morne, Betamax, City Power et BAI.   

 

Par ailleurs, Madam Speaker, une chose devrait beaucoup nous inquiéter d’après moi.  

Mais, le discours du budget ne dit rien sur le current account déficit du pays, et cela, malgré 

le fait que tout le monde est d’accord, que le current account deficit d’un pays est la mesure 

la plus fondamentale de la santé économique de toutes économies ouvertes comme la nôtre.  

Et le budget  ne dit rien  non plus  sur l’impact  à  venir, des  amendements  au  double taxation 

agreement  entre  l’Inde  et  Maurice,    l’impact  de  ces  changements  sur  notre  current  account 

deficit dans les années à venir.  En effet, Madam Speaker, le déficit de notre current account 

a été d’environ 5% du GDP en 2015, soit R 20 milliards, mais si on y inclut les capitaux, les 

financials  flows,  que  les  Global  Business  Companies  (GBCs)  font  transiter  au  pays  vers 

l’Inde.  Les conseillers me disent que si on exclut ces GBCs related flows, le current account 

 

 

11 

deficit en 2015 passe à 10% du GDP.  Ce qui amène certains experts, Madam Speaker, à dire 

que, je cite – 

 

“Mauritius is highly dependent on GBC related net inflows to maintain a reasonable 

external  current  account  deficit  which  is  not  sustainable  in  the  medium-term  in  the 

wake of the amended doubled taxation agreement with India.” 

 Et ces mêmes experts, y compris le FMI, estiment que  sans ces GBC flows, la roupie aurait à 

être dévaluée jusqu’à 25%.   

 

Madam  Speaker,  cette  année,  en  cette  occasion,  je  ne  parlerai  pas  aujourd’hui  des 

grands  projets  dont  on  entend  plus  parler  comme  par  magie,  tels  que    JINFAI,  un  nouveau 

port de pêche à Bain des Dames, le projet des investisseurs Chinois au Domaines des Pailles, 

le projet d’un autre groupe d’investisseurs Chinois, supposément, à Roches Noires.  Je n’en 

parlerai pas et je ne parlerai pas non plus en cette occasion du LRT, de la CWA, du CEB, de 

la Cargo Handling Corporation, ni pour cette fois de Rodrigues et d’Agalega, afin de revenir 

cette année à l’essentiel, de mon point de vue, à l’économie en général, et sur le fait que ce 

budget n’est pas un budget de relance économique et de création d’emplois.   

 

Madam  Speaker,  mon  message  essentiel  aujourd’hui  est  que  notre  économie  est  en 

panne and we have no easy choices.  C’est pourquoi je disais ‘bisin aret badiné !’  Il faut dire 

la vérité à la population, et en particulier à la jeunesse.   Il faut cesser de lui promettre des 

miracles économiques qui ne sont que des mirages et du bluff dangereux.  Il faut cesser de lui 

faire croire à cette population et à cette jeunesse que tout est possible en économie et qu’on 

peut continuer à sacrifier le budget de développement  au profit du budget de fonctionnement 

de l’Etat.  Il faut lui dire, Madam Speaker, que pour relancer  l’économie et créer les milliers 

d’emplois productifs auxquels notre jeunesse à droit, we have no easy choices.   

 

Madam  Speaker,  nous  sommes  un  petit  pays  avec  un  ageing  population,  et  ce  petit 

pays  est  déjà  lourdement  endetté,  tout  comme  l’est  notre  secteur  privé  lui  aussi,  où  je  le 

rappelais, il y a quelques minutes, le taux d’investissement est tombé au record low de 12.5% 

du GDP.  Madam Speaker, les projets d’investissements productifs et d’avenir, sont de plus 

en plus difficiles à trouver.  Les nouveaux secteurs économiques à développer sont de plus en 

plus  difficiles  à  identifier.    We  have  no  easy  choices  pour  relancer  l’économie,  Madam 

Speaker.    Bien sûr, il faut  d’abord s’appuyer sur les secteurs déjà  existants  ou performants, 

tels que l’ICT Sector, le secteur financier, le tourisme et  il faut,  bien sûr, casser les  goulots 

d’étranglement, tels que lack of skills and labour availability.   

 

 

12 

Mais, Madame la présidente, de mon point de vue, la gravité de la situation exige que 

nous  revoyions  notre  economic  and  business  model  dans  son  ensemble  et  que  nous  ne 

négligeons aucun nouveau créneau exploitable comme en 2000/2005. 

Amongst other things, Madam Speaker, we must refocus on high value production for 

export  markets  and  we  must  fine-tune  our  investments  abroad.    We  must  review  the  whole 

situation concerning the blue economy. 

Mais,  Madame  la  présidente,  tout  cela  restera  lettre  morte  s’il  n’y  a  pas  à  la  tête  du 

pays  une  équipe  économique  d’une  compétence  à  toute  épreuve  qui  fasse  preuve 

d’imagination, mais aussi de réalisme et qui donne l’exemple de la discipline au travail et du 

teamwork with the required leadership. 

Madam Speaker, Mauritius  is  at  a crossroad.   Un nouveau départ  a été  raté l’année 

dernière.    Nous  avons  perdu  une  année.    La  situation  est  dramatique  and  we  have  no  easy 

choices.  C’est là le message que j’ai choisi de faire passer cette année après le départ raté de 

mon point de vue de l’année dernière. 

We have no easy choices, Madam Speaker.  Mais notre destin reste entre nos mains et 

notre jeunesse est en droit d’exiger de nous tous qu’on lui tienne un langage de vérité et que 

ceux qui gouvernent le pays le fassent avec courage, compétence et dévouement à la cause du 

pays et son développement. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

Madam Speaker: The Rt. hon. Prime Minister! 

(10.27 a.m.) 

The Prime Minister: Madam Speaker, it is with a deep sense of pride that I stand to 

speak  on  the  2016-2017  Budget.  I  heartily  congratulate  the  Minister  of  Finance  and 

Economic Development for presenting to the nation a well thought, bold and daring Budget. 

I am proud because the Minister has brilliantly lived up to the trust I placed in him. 

I am  proud because  I am  confident  that the leadership that  I will leave as legacy to 

this  country  is  mature,  wise  and  farsighted  and  espouses  the  human  touch  that  makes  the 

difference in the heart of the people. 

Indeed, Madam Speaker, we have in the 2016-2017 Budget the trait and imprint of a 

Minister and leader who has addressed carefully  both  the social and economic concerns of 

 

 

13 

the country. He has gone out of the traditional thinking pattern to embrace new approaches 

that have impressed the nation at large.  

The positive titles in the Press and the nationwide positive reactions are testimony to 

the wide acclamation the Budget has commanded. 

I  have  been  in  this  august  Assembly  for  years  as  Prime  Minister,  but  never  before 

had  I  heard  hon.  Paul  Bérenger,  as  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  saying  “c’est  un  budget 

intéressant”. I compliment him for the compliment. 

But nevertheless, I must only remind the House to look back all the Budgets that we 

presented in this House since 1983 up to the end of our mandate.  The same criticisms and 

same  negative  attitude,  the  hon.  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  had  always  in  his  mind  and 

expressed  in  this  House.  Yet,  everybody  knows  the  result  after  our  mandate  of  five  years 

since 1983; we did not invent the word ‘miracle économique’, others invented that, even the 

IMF and the World Bank spoke about economic miracle of Mauritius.  But had we believed 

all the way in what the hon. Leader of the Opposition was saying about our administration of 

the economy, the country would certainly have been bankrupt and there would have been no 

miracle économique, Madam Speaker. 

I  also  heard  with  much  interest  hon.  Bhagwan  stating  that  there  are  “positive  and 

innovative measures” in the Budget. 

There  is  no  doubt,  therefore,  that  the  Budget  presented  by  the  Minister  of  Finance 

and Economic Development has rallied the nation except for the Labour Party that no longer 

has any credibility in the eyes of the vast majority of the population. 

I  read  with  amusement  the  former  Prime  Minister  and  leader  of  the  Labour  Party 

saying that the Minister of Finance “est en rupture avec la réalité”. The response to that on 

Facebook has been overwhelmingly damning for him. He has been abruptly reminded of the 

reality  he  inflicted  on  the  nation  with  his  coffers  overflowing  with  bank  notes,  mistresses, 

nepotism,  corruption  and  anti-social  measures.  From  what  I  have  read  on  Facebook,  I  can 

say  without  any  hesitation  that  the  former  Prime  Minister  has  become  not  only  the 

nightmare, but also the laughing stock of the population and that his gesticulations no longer 

impress or frighten anyone. 

Hon.  Shakeel  Mohamed  has  hammered  the  nail  further  in  the  coffin  of  the  Labour 

Party  and  retorted  cynically  to  his  Leader  by  stating  in  his  intervention  last  Thursday  that 

“the Labour Government under Navin Ramgoolam was disconnected from the reality”.  This 

 

 

14 

former Prime Minister has the guts to say that the Minister of Finance has committed rupture 

de la réalité. What a slap was it in the face of the former Prime Minister? The hon. Member, 

however,  went  on  to  say  that  he  cannot  see  how  the  Budget  is  a  “budget  de  rupture”.  I 

disagree totally with him and also with the Leader of the Opposition as it is amply clear that 

the  measures  in  the  2016-2017  Budget  address  both  the  social  and  economic  realities  and 

challenges faced by the country. 

Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, Budget 2016-2017 embraces new approaches and 

innovative responses. It inspires a much needed wave of change and liberates the economy 

from the chains of the past. It is a Budget forged out of a genuine willingness to satisfy the 

aspirations of our youth and the population at large.  

And more to it, Madam Speaker, the 2016-2017 Budget lays down the ten pathways 

to  transform  Mauritius  into  what  has  been  described  in  the  Government  Programme  2015-

2019,  as  a  truly  forward  looking,  environmentally  sustainable,  economically  vibrant  and 

innovative  country  with  modern  infrastructure,  global  connectivity,  high  skills,  technology 

and socially inclusive development. The road to the Second Economic Miracle is now wide 

open  despite  what  has  been  said  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.  If  we  have  to  tread 

confidently  with  zeal  and  determination,  we  have  to  be  ambitious.  We  have  to  act  like 

achievers.  I  have  retained  one  sentence  of  the  Budget  Speech  which  summarises  the 

underlying approach of the Minister. I quote:  

 “The  challenges  of  tomorrow  cannot  be  met  with  our  mindset,  policies  and 

actions locked in the paradigm of yesterday”. 

Indeed, Madam Speaker, the 2016-2017 Budget is set to achieve meaningful change which is 

the motto  of our Government Programme.  It  is  meant  to  be a  game-changer.  It  is  meant  to 

usher in a new cycle of growth and shape a new Mauritius where there will be opportunities 

for one and all. 

 

In the Budget, the Minister of Finance has ensured that there is a share for everyone  - 

 

 

from the young student still in primary school to the adult attending university;  

from the mother cooking food for her family every day to the big corporations 

providing jobs to thousands and contributing to economic development, and 

 

from  the  citizen  worried  about  the  deteriorating  environment  to  the 

technology-savvy person willing to develop mobile applications.    

 

 

15 

Indeed,  the  ten  key  strategies  highlighted  in  the  Budget  touch  upon  every  aspect  of  society 

and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  modern  and  technology  driven  Mauritius. This  economic 

roadmap will be driven by our very own Mauritian entrepreneurs. The objective is to develop 

a  vibrant  SME  sector  and  the  Budget  rightly  comes  forward  with  measures  for  this  to 

happen.   

 

Payment of trade fees have been suspended for three years. Nobody thought about it 

before. Tax holidays are being given to SMEs and a National SME Incubator Scheme will be 

created. Furthermore, access  to  finance and technical  expertise will be made easier with  the 

announced SME parks,  SME Financing Scheme, revival of  LEMS, factoring services and a 

new Venture Capital Fund.   

I think the message to all entrepreneurs is this: Forget all the hassles. Focus on your 

business.  Develop  it  and  make  it  a  success.   All  the  necessary  tools  are  now  available. 

However,  Madam  Speaker,  the  expected  success  cannot  be  achieved  without  the  proper 

support  and  facilities  in  place. Our  economy  possesses  good  IT  infrastructure  and 

connectivity and we are lucky to be situated in a strategic position of the globe.   

Mauritius  ranks  first  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  in  the  Global  Competitiveness  Report 

and,  according  to  ICT  Price  Basket,  also  offers  the  cheapest  ICT  services  in  Africa. Yet, 

much remains to be done. The country must close the digital divide with advanced economies 

to  be  more  competitive  and  therefore  more  attractive.   Being  first  in  Africa  is  no  longer 

enough.  We aim and are aiming much higher, regionally and also globally. This is why the 

proposed Information Highway to share information among public sector agencies comes at a 

most appropriate time. This initiative alongside new e-services announced in the public sector 

will  provide  a  more  convenient  lifestyle  for  all  our  citizens. Queues  and  waiting  time  will 

decrease. We  will  save  on  both  time  and  costs. In  turn,  this  will  lead  to  a  rise  in  efficiency 

and  productivity. Mauritius  will  thus  become  more  competitive  and  these  gains  will 

ultimately benefit businesses.   It will pave the way  for Mauritius to  become a  global centre 

for  business  and  financial  activities. Mauritius  will  open  up  and  become  even  more 

accessible.   

The Bank of Mauritius is  coming up with  a National  Payment  Switch while MEXA 

and Government aim to develop a national e-commerce platform.  This will allow worldwide 

selling of products and services.

The  domestic  environment  is  also  being  enhanced. 153  billion  rupees  will  be  spent 

over  the  next  five  years  to  enhance  our  infrastructure  and  drastically  change  the  socio-

economic landscape.   

Numerous  projects  will  be  executed.   Prominent  among  these  is  the  Metro  Express 

project. The current transport system is a major source of pressure and stress for our citizens. 

The  Metro  Express  project  will  provide  a  lasting  solution  to  this  problem. This  project  will 

redesign our towns, create new growth poles and cut down pollution, but the biggest benefit 

will be for our citizens. Anxiously waiting for the bus and then spending hours in traffic jams 

will be things of the past.  Moreover, the death toll from road accidents is set to go down. 

Madam Speaker, the former Prime Minister dares to say that LRT is his project and 

that  my  Government  has  had  to  backpedal  after  initially  freezing  it.  Allow  me,  Madam 

Speaker, to enlighten the population on the LRT project.  

The light rail project would have been there in 1995. I was going forward, but there 

was so much criticism by the Opposition and it was being insinuated that I was going to get a 

big commission out of it that I got so disgusted and I even went for new elections. Therefore 

the former Prime Minister who says he has vision; if he had vision for this country, he would 

not have inherited what we have inherited. We had to put order in all the fields that were left 

there.  Of  course,  I  agree  that  the  Budget  presented  by  the  former  Minister  of  Finance,  I, 

myself, came to the conclusion that it was not a realistic one, but, nevertheless, when people 

come  and  say  that  in  one  year  we  have  done  nothing,  well,  I  take  it  as  a  joke.  Everybody 

knows  that  the  MSM-MMM  Government  of  2000-2005  had  decided  to  go  ahead  with  the 

LRT project.  

However,  when  the  Labour  Party  was  in  power  in  the  2006-2010  period,  they 

preferred, instead of LRT, the Bus Rapid Transit system. And what was it, that there would 

be  bus  lanes.  I  don’t  know  whether  the  bus  lanes  should  have  gone  over  the  residences  of 

people in this country. 

The  Prime  Minister  and  his  Minister  of  Public  Infrastructure  at  that  time  defended 

forcefully  the  BRT,  both  in  this  august  Assembly  and  outside.  Then,  for  the  2010  general 

elections, the MSM insisted for the LRT project to be brought back on the national agenda as 

the party had made of LRT a lynchpin of its socio-economic transformation strategy. 

I  am  informed  that  the  then  Prime  Minister  reluctantly  accepted  that  the  LRT  be 

mentioned  in  the  electoral  manifesto  of  the  then  l’Alliance  de  l’Avenir.  Following  the 

 

 

17 

general elections, the LRT project was revived by the then and present Minister of Finance. 

There had been a few meetings where it had been found that the cost would not exceed Rs15 

billion. 

Despite all efforts to persuade the then Prime Minister to opt for the LRT project, he 

kept  on insisting on the  BRT, until  the time he  made an official  visit  to  Singapore. On his 

return, he said he had been seduced and started defending LRT with zeal. I will tell you in a 

moment, to what extent the seduction reached. But, when the cost figures were known, the 

Nation was shocked. 

From Rs15 billion, the cost escalated to Rs24.8 billion, nearly Rs10 billion more in a 

mere three year lapse of time. At that cost the LRT project was simply not affordable. And 

when this Government came to power, we decided to freeze it on a question of affordability. 

It  is  only  when  I  had  been  made  aware  in  March  this  year  of  certain  information  and  new 

elements  as  regards  the  cost  of  the  project  that  I  gave  the  green  light  for  the  project  to  be 

revisited. 

I draw attention to the word ‘affordable’ mentioned in the Budget Speech. The Metro 

Express  project,  I  insist,  have  been  revived  and  will  be  implemented  as  we  now  have 

guarantee on affordability. 

In due course, the genuine cost will be known and then the population will discover 

what  happened  during  the  seduction  exercise  that  started  in  Singapore  and  was  pursued  in 

Mauritius. 

I heard the former Prime Minister saying so passionately at a public gathering that he 

brought  to  Mauritius  a  lady  Rottweiler  from  Singapore  to  pilot  the  project.  I  sought  for 

information  and  understood  the  real  reason  why  the  former  Prime  Minister  suddenly  got 

seduced  by  the  LRT.  I  have  information  on  a  particular  ‘tunnel  experience’.  Madam 

Speaker, I will refrain from going any further on that. 

The  Metro  Express  will  become  reality  under  this  Government.  That  is  more 

important than anything else. 

And  history  always  records  the  achievers  for  the  common  good  of  a  whole  nation, 

not the greedy scoundrels who loot for their selfish interests. 

Madam Speaker, I now come to the Heritage City Project. I will be frank and direct as 

usual.  I  am  really  sad  by  the  turn  of  events.  It  was  a  project  that  would  have  portrayed  the 

 

 

18 

advanced  country  we  want  Mauritius  to  become.  It  would  have  been  the  icon  of  our  future 

development  path.  It  would  have  a  model  in  terms  of  public  sector  efficiency  and 

productivity.    This  was  a  project  which  I  had  at  heart  and  I  am  really  sorry  for  what  has 

happened. 

But views diverge largely on the project and it was decided to set it aside. As Prime 

Minister evolving in  a democratic system and within an Alliance,  I have to  let the majority 

have its way and I stand by that collective decision. 

Madam  Speaker,  some  in  this  House  and  outside,  including  the  former  Prime 

Minister,  have  argued  that  the  Minister  of  Finance  has  disavowed  me  by  insisting  on 

construction and property development as the main pillar of economic development. 

First of all, the 2016-2017 Budget does not put all the eggs in the basket of property 

development. 

It covers the whole spectrum of our economic sectors and gives a boost to all of them. 

Second, I never said that construction and property development should be stopped. 

I opined that we should also focus on the other sectors of our economy so that there is 

a boom at a point in time and that would mean we have achieved our objective of delivering a 

Second Economic Miracle. 

That  is  exactly  what  the  Minister  of  Finance  has  done  through  the  Budget  and  I 

congratulate him for that. 

Madam Speaker, Mauritius has been amongst the first countries to respond concretely 

to the Brexit threat on its trade and economy. 

The  decision  announced  in  the  Budget  to  set  up  a  major  Air  Freight  Scheme  which 

will entail a 40 per cent reduction by Air Mauritius of the air freight cost to Europe will no 

doubt  improve  the  competitiveness  of  our  exports,  mainly  our  textile  products  and  apparel. 

Government will underwrite the scheme for two years. I believe it is a major initiative which 

has to be commended. 

Madam  Speaker,  I  always  insist  on  the  fact  that  socio-economic  development  must 

not be done at the cost of destroying our environment.  Mauritius is already a premier tourist 

destination, known for its pristine beaches, blue lagoon and greenery. 

 

 

19 

Yet,  I  believe  that  the  time  has  come  to  take  things  to  another  level.  The  word  is 

SUSTAINABILITY. We are building for the generations to come. 

We are building a green and a blue economy.  Never before have so many measures 

been announced for blue and green economy. 

Back  in  December  2015,  Mauritius  signed  the  COP  21  Agreement  and  committed 

itself to producing energy from renewable sources.  Indeed, we simply cannot continue to do 

things as they  were being done in  the past.   The time for change has come.  Consequently, 

CEB will create a renewable energy company, which will ultimately become a special vehicle 

for  the  production  of  electricity  from  solar  photovoltaic  systems  of  up  to  15  Megawatts.  I 

fully support this initiative. 

The company will subsequently open its shareholding to SMEs, cooperative societies 

and small investors, thus bringing the democratisation process in the energy sector to another 

level. 

Production  of  electricity  will  be  liberalised.  The  SSDG  and  recently  announced 

MMDG Net Metering schemes by CEB have benefitted from a good response and attracted 

many people.  It shows that the move towards renewable energy is the right one; one that is 

supported by the population. 

Feasibility studies will be carried out on production of electricity through solar panels 

placed on rooftop of houses and the CEB will invest Rs400 m. to increase the grid absorption 

capacity of intermittent energy from 148 to 160 megawatts by 2018. 

It  will  also  procure  battery  storage  systems  so  as  to  become  resilient  to  the 

intermittent  nature  of  renewable  energy.    Furthermore,  there  will  now  be  no  VAT  on 

photovoltaic inverters and batteries. 

We  believe  in  a  green  economy  and  we  believe  in  protecting  this  beautiful 

environment of ours. We are now bringing our beliefs and wishes to reality. But, at the same 

time, I must emphasize that this question of environment must not be a pretext for all those 

who are against development and who don’t want to see this Government succeed, to come 

forward and raise their voices against all development that we are trying  to  bring and put  a 

stop to all of them so that, in the end, they can come and say: “You see, this Government had 

been bluffing. There has been no development there has been no creation of jobs.” And, this 

is exactly their plan. This is what they want, but we are not going to be fooled by all sorts of 

voices that we hear outside. 

 

 

20 

Madam  Speaker,  I  now  come  to  the  Blue  Economy.  In  addition  to  the  avenues  that 

have  so  far  been  explored,  namely  aquaculture,  marine  renewable  energy  and  deep  water 

applications for cooling facilities, we seek to explore our seabed for economic benefits. The 

prospects  of  finding  and  exploiting  hydrocarbons  and  minerals  in  our  Exclusive  Economic 

Zone would be a potential game changer for our economy. I am pleased to announce that we 

are inviting Expressions of Interest for the conduct of exploration surveys in our waters. 

My office has been monitoring very closely the progress in the Joint Management of 

the Extended Continental Shelf between Mauritius and Seychelles.  

The  two  countries  are  now  jointly  exercising  sovereign  rights  for  the  purpose  of  exploring 

and exploiting seabed resources. Mauritius and Seychelles launched a call for proposal for the 

conduct  of  geophysical  surveys  in  the  Joint  Zone.  I  can  announce  that  seven  international 

companies  responded  and  a  shortlisting  has  been  carried  out  jointly  by  the  two  States.  The 

selection exercise is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 

Madam  Speaker,  the  picture  will  not  be  complete  if  we  were  not  to  include  a  full 

assessment of our marine living and non-living resources. A specialised Department  for the 

Continental Shelf, Maritime Zones Administration and Exploration has been set up under my 

Office  for  the  administration  of  the  continental  shelf,  maritime  delimitation  and  for  the 

development of the seabed exploration activities.  

In collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat and all the relevant stakeholders, 

this  department  has  completed  a  first  draft  of  an  Offshore  Petroleum  Bill  and  a  Seabed 

Mineral Bill. The Attorney General’s Office is presently reviewing these drafts and the Bills 

will be introduced in the National Assembly in due course. 

Nevertheless, no one can claim to know the full potential of the ocean.  That is why 

we require the appropriate cutting-edge technology and research.  And we have decided that 

this knowledge will be developed locally. We are coming with a plan to harness the talents of 

our own people.   Indeed, we believe that we have the talent  to  conduct  pioneering research 

right here in Mauritius. The country has the potential to become a world class research centre.  

The time has come to realise it.   

We are therefore signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Institute 

of Goa to set up a World Class Research Institute of Oceanography in Mauritius. 20 million 

rupees has also been earmarked to purchase a multi-purpose vessel for research, surveys and 

training of fishermen and skippers.  

 

 

21 

When  we  talk  about  blue  economy,  our  fishermen  immediately  spring  to  our  mind.  

This Budget has not forgotten them. A grant of 50%, up to a cap of 4 million rupees, will be 

given  to  cooperative  societies  to  acquire  semi-industrial  vessels.  In  the  same  vein,  a  tax 

holiday  of  eight  years  is  being  provided  to  attract  industrial  fishing  companies  to  operate 

from Mauritius. 

Madam Speaker, the Minister of Finance has also been attentive to the concerns of the 

planter community. I am pleased by the series of new measures that have been announced to 

bring  the  agri-business  sector  into  the  new  economic  cycle.  We  all  know  that  the  planter 

community  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  socio-economic  development  in  Mauritius.  They 

deserve our consideration and the Minister of Finance has not let them down. 

Madam  Speaker,  I  have  been  talking  about  economic  development  so  far  –  digital 

economy,  blue  economy,  green  economy,  SMEs  and  so  on.    True  it  is  that  the  Budget 

contains numerous measures to propel the economy to new levels and that cannot be denied. 

But its social dimension is as praiseworthy. There is an unprecedented will power to do away 

with absolute poverty in our country. 

The  2016-2017  Budget  concretely  launches  the  Marshall  Plan  Against  Poverty.  

Indeed, the new scheme under which every adult on the Social Register will be entitled to a 

monthly subsistence allowance based on a threshold of 2,720 Rupees is commendable. This 

threshold is 40% higher than the World Bank’s absolute poverty threshold of USD 3.10 per 

day  per  individual  calculated  on  the  basis  of  purchasing  power  parity.    This  means  that 

henceforth we shall be wiping out absolute poverty as per World Bank’s criteria.  

It  is  historical,  although  we  must  see  to  it  that  those  we  are  supporting  do  actually 

come out of the poverty trap. That’s where the social contract that will be engaged with the 

families  concerned  will  have  all  its  importance.  500  million  Rupees  will  be  spent  on  this 

initiative in a two-year period and by so doing we shall be progressing steadily on our agenda 

to meet the objectives of the SDGs as regards poverty alleviation.  

As a nation, we have to help and support the down-trodden and I appeal to everybody 

who has the means to complement Government’s efforts in that direction. The Marshall Plan 

also focuses on decent housing and the Budget adequately provides for it.   

The  country  will  also  need  a  good  quality  of  life.    People  should  have  the  basic 

necessities.  And housing is one of them.  Who has not dreamt of owning a house?  Who does 

 

 

22 

not  dream  of  the  day  when  his  whole  family  will  eat  dinner  together  under  one  roof?    The 

Budget has come forward with measures to make this dream come true for every citizen.   

One billion rupees will be spent on the construction and completion of 1,900 housing 

units and an additional 800 houses will be erected over three years. The eligibility threshold 

has also been enlarged to a monthly income of up to 20,000 Rupees; hence, including even 

more people in the bracket. On top of that, a plethora of incentives has been put in place to 

help young couples acquire residential property. 

Madam  Speaker, this Government  has done a lot since  coming to  power  to  increase 

the purchasing power of the population. I have asked for updated figures and I can say they 

are  really  impressive  ones.  In  2015  and  up  to  financial  year  2016-2017,  we  will  be  giving 

families  as  much  as  20  billion  rupees  in  terms  of  purchasing  power  through  pensions, 

subsidies, tax exemptions, salary  compensations  and direct  support.   This  is  unprecedented, 

Madam Speaker. 

Madam  Speaker,  I  now  come  to  departments  and  institutions  falling  under  my 

portfolio of responsibilities. For the financial year 2016-2017, a total amount of Rs8.7 billion 

is being allocated to the Police Department, which represents an increase of around 10%, as 

compared  to  last  year.  The  focus  will  be  on  the  following  five  major  avenues:  technology; 

road  safety;  effective  surveillance;  securing  of  our  borders,  and  revamping  of  the  human 

resource element. 

Regarding  the  introduction  of  state-of-the-art  technology,  we  shall  be  investing  in 

Intelligent-cop  concept  for  our  officers  on  ground.    These  will  include  smart  tablets,  body 

worn  cameras,  mobile  access  to  data  points,  tracking  systems  for  vehicles,  and  a  Crime 

Occurrence Tracking System. 

Also,  an  enhanced  digital  radio  communication  system  will  link  up  other  agencies 

such as the SAMU and the Fire Services, amongst others. The smart tablets will be issued to 

patrol  units  such  as  ERS  and  Traffic  Police  and  will  facilitate  instant  access  to  vehicle 

ownership and criminal databases. 

The  Mauritius  Police  Force  will  be  acquiring  two  drone  cameras,  estimated  at 

Rs150,000  each,  equipped  with  night  vision  capabilities,  for  intelligence  gathering, 

surveillance of suspects and ships suspected to be carrying drugs. They will also be used for 

difficult drugs operations by the ADSU. 

 

 

23 

As regards road safety, to intensify surveillance on our roads, more vehicles are being 

acquired  for  the  Traffic  Police.  43  new  motorcycles  have  been  purchased  recently,  and 

procedures  have  already  been  initiated  for  the  purchase  of  56  additional  ones.  Crime 

prevention  through  effective  surveillance  also  remains  a  priority  for  Government.    In  this 

context,  we  shall  be  implementing  a  Safe  City  project,  which  has  been  announced  in  the 

Budget.    Under  this  project,  crime  prone  areas  will  be  identified  and  high  quality  CCTV 

cameras with latest technology will be installed at strategic locations throughout the island to 

ensure  a  constant  sharp  surveillance  in  high  risk  areas.  All  these  initiatives  will  obviously 

contribute to ensure law and order in the country. 

Madam  Speaker,  to  further  protect  our  country  from  the  threats  of  transnational 

crimes,  including  terrorism,  piracy,  and  human  trafficking,  we  will  be  enhancing  the 

operational capacity of our National Coast Guard through the acquisition of new surveillance 

assets.  A  new  Dornier  aircraft  equipped  with  state-of-the-art  radar  has  been  acquired  last 

month. In March, ten fast interceptor boats have joined the National Coast Guard’s fleet and 

by  October  this  year,  we  shall  commission  a  new  water  jet  fast  attack  vessel.    Madam 

Speaker,  in  addition,  Government  will  recruit  1,200  Police  Officers  and  appoint  30  new 

Cadet  Officers  in  different  specialised  streams  such  as  Research  and  Development, 

Engineering and Information Technology, and several others. 

The future new Police Academy would be one of the major Police projects this year, 

estimated  at  a  cost  of  Rs775.5  m.  It  will  be  equipped  with  all  modern  facilities  required  to 

enhance the human resource capability of the Police Force.  

Madam  Speaker,  due 

to 

the 

increasing  demand  for  forensic  analyses  and 

investigations,  the  Forensic  Science  Laboratory  urgently  needs  to  be  relocated  in  purpose 

built new facilities. For that purpose, State land of a size of 10,146 square metres at La Vigie, 

Curepipe,  has  been  made  available  for  the  construction  of  a  new  FSL  building  to  house  its 

laboratories. 

The project,  at a cost of around Rs235 m., is expected to be completed in 2019. For 

this financial  year a sum of Rs25 m. has been allocated for the appointment of a consultant 

for the design and preliminary phase. The FSL has extended its services to Rodrigues by the 

setting  up  of  an  antenna  in  the  Police  compound  at  Plaine  Corail.  I  can  also  announce  that 

consideration is being given for the FSL to equip itself with equine lab facilities in order to 

help the Police to effectively act in cases of alleged doping. 

 

 

24 

Madam Speaker, with regard to border management, Government is working towards 

the introduction of an Advance Passenger Information system, which would help the border 

control  authorities  to  have  passengers  manifest  for  all  flights  coming  to  Mauritius.  This 

would help to check the names against the control list and take appropriate and timely action, 

thus enhancing the internal security measures. 

We are also reviewing our immigration legislation in order to prevent an abuse from 

foreigners  who  seek  to  marry  Mauritians  solely  for  the  sake  of  obtaining  residence  permits 

and eventually Mauritian citizenship. In that connection, an Immigration (Amendment) Bill is 

being finalised and will be introduced in Parliament when ready. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to reaffirm Government's commitment in promoting the 

adoption  of  e-business  and  leveraging  our  strengths  in  the  exploitation  of  innovative 

technologies. In this respect, my Office has launched the e-tender for the implementation of 

an  E-Business  project  for  the  Home  Affairs  Department  to  provide  the  following  services 

online - 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of Citizenship Certificate; 

issue of Certificate under the Non-Citizenship Property Restriction Act; 

issue of Apostille Certificate under the Hague Convention; 

processing of Residence Permit; 

processing of visa, and 

processing of request to access VIP/State lounge at the Airport. 

The estimated cost of this project is Rs75 m. 

Madam  Speaker,  with  regard  to  adoption  of  children,  Government  signed  in  May 

2016  an  Agreement  for  technical  assistance  with  the  Permanent  Bureau  of  the  Hague 

Conference on Private International Law. That aims at undertaking the inter-country adoption 

regime in line with the Hague Convention. 

In this respect,  an international  expert has been  deputed in  Mauritius to  assist  in  the 

drafting of a new inter-country adoption legislation, to advise on an appropriate structure as 

central authority and to provide capacity building on the Convention. The new Adoption Bill 

is expected to be presented in the National Assembly in March 2017. 

My  Office  had  also  officially  released  the  report  of  the  National  Coalition  against 

Domestic Violence Committee earlier this year to give a major thrust to eradicate the problem 

of  domestic  violence  in  Mauritius.  The  focus  will  be  on  empowerment  of  the  enforcement 

 

 

25 

agencies,  better  coordination  among  all  stakeholders  and  adoption  of  a  victim  centred 

approach. 

Madam  Speaker,  I  commend  the  decision  to  increase  religious  subsidies  by  10%.  I 

must point out that there has not been any increase in religious subsidies since 2009. 

Being  a  multi-cultural  and  multi-ethnic  country,  we  have  had  to  struggle  over  the 

years to maintain our reputation as a peaceful country, respectful of the rights of its people. 

 

I, therefore, join the Minister of Finance in paying tribute to the valuable contribution 

of  all  religious  organisations  in  ensuring  unity  in  our  diversity.  I  make  an  appeal  to  these 

organisations  to  use  the  additional  money  to  undertake  sensitization  programmes  and 

campaigns  to  ward  off  the  social  ills  caused  by  alcoholism,  drug  abuse,  domestic  violence 

and extremism. 

 

Madam  Speaker,  I  wish  to  reaffirm  to  the  House  my  unflinching  commitment  to 

uphold  human  rights  values  in  this  country.    The  aim  of  my  Government  is  to  create  an 

appropriate  human  rights  climate  conducive  for  economic,  social  and  cultural  development. 

In  this  context,  the  Independent  Police  Complaints  Commission  separate  from  the  National 

Human  Rights  Commission  will  be  set  up to  deal  solely  with  complaints against  the  Police 

officers.  To that effect, a sum of Rs15 m. has been provided in the new Budget. 

 

Madam  Speaker,  Foreign  Investment  is  crucial  for  the  expansion  of  our  economy.  

Under the Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act, for financial  year 2015/2016, my Office 

approved 32 applications from non-citizens for an approximate investment amount of Rs4.2 

billion.   

 

With  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Non-Citizens  (Property  Restriction)  Act,  as 

announced  in  the  Budget  Speech,  and  the  further  streamlining  of  procedures  for  issue  of 

permits, applicants  for Occupation Permits in  the  Investor and Self-employed  categories, as 

well as applicants for Residence Permits in the Retired non-citizens categories will be able to 

apply online without need for prior registration of business or transfer of funds.  This will be 

a major step towards enhancing the ease of doing business in Mauritius. 

 

Madam  Speaker,  my  Government  is  fully  committed  to  supporting  the  development 

of  Rodrigues  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Republic  of  Mauritius.  Accordingly,  decisions  have 

been taken to improve air and sea connectivity with Mauritius.  The runway of the Sir Gaëtan 

Duval Airport in Rodrigues will be extended to accommodate A319 aircrafts serving regional 

routes.  This  will  enable  Air  Mauritius  to  optimize  aircraft  use  while  at  the  same  time 

satisfying the growing demands for seats between Mauritius and Rodrigues. In addition, the 

 

 

26 

existing airport terminal will be expanded to provide increased surface for operational spaces 

in the terminal building. 

 

In  order  to  bridge  the  digital  gap  between  Rodrigues  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  the 

Mauritius-Rodrigues  leg  of  the  Third  Submarine  Cable  Project  will  be  implemented  in  due 

course.  Meanwhile,  an  additional  300  Megabyte  per  second  bandwidth  will  be  provided  to 

enhance connectivity. 

 

With  regard  to  sea  connectivity,  a  new  Port  Master  Plan  is  being  prepared  by  the 

MPA,  for  Rodrigues,  which  would  take  into  account  new  infrastructure  requirements  and 

policies  in  relation  to  Port  area  activities  such  as  fish  processing,  Port  handling  and  marina 

development. 

 

Madam  Speaker, we are also  supportive of the breeding community in  Rodrigues as 

they go through very hard times with the onslaught of the foot-and-mouth epidemic on cattle. 

Breeders in Rodrigues will be provided with a financial breather and other assistance.  

 

Madam Speaker, I also wish to commend the Minister of Finance for the inclusion of 

the Chagos Archipelago and Tromelin in the section relating to our outer islands. This simple 

mention  sends  a  strong  signal  and  reinforces  even  more  our  stand  that  the  Chagos 

Archipelago and Tromelin form an integral part of our territory. 

 

As I said last Thursday, in reply to the PNQ of the Leader of the Opposition, we are 

pursuing  our  initiatives  at  the  level  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  to  seek  an 

advisory opinion on the Chagos Archipelago issue from the International Court of Justice. As 

always, I shall make a forceful appeal to the UN member States to support us in our struggle 

for the effective exercise by Mauritius of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago in the 

forthcoming General Assembly.  

 

Madam Speaker, I must make it clear why I have finally chosen this course of action, 

because when I first became Prime Minister, I met the Prime Minister in UK and I raised this 

question of Chagos Archipelago.  And she assured me that it was needed - the term that late 

Margaret  Thatcher  used  -  for  the  defense  of  the  West.    And  when  I  asked  her:  “how  is  the 

West  being  threatened?”  She  explained  to  me  the  Soviet  Union  was  a  real  threat  and  there 

was the Cold War, and she attributed the Cold War to the Soviet Union.  Anyway, I thought it 

was a plausible explanation, and I said: “When this threat will no longer be there, Chagos will 

be returned to Mauritius.”  And she told me: “Yes”.  She told me that I can rest assured. 

 

 

27 

 

Today, we know that Soviet Union is no longer there; Cold War is not there, there is 

no  threat  to  the  West.    So,  now,  when  I  talked  to  the  Britishers:    “Why  do  you  still  need 

Chagos?”  What do they say now?  For defense purposes.  For the defense against piracy and 

terrorism, particularly in the Indian Ocean?  They want to preserve peace and security in the 

Indian Ocean.  Finally, as I understand it, they are there to assure peace and security of the 

world.  They are the boss, they are the masters and we must kneel.  I came to the conclusion 

that  it  is  clear  that  they  had  no  intention  whatsoever,  ever,  to  return  Chagos  to  Mauritius 

because there will always be some problems here and there.  Do they need a base with atomic 

bombs to fight piracy and terrorism?  I consider this not serious at all! The Britishers or, at 

least,  the  British  Government  –  I  don’t  blame  the  whole  people  of  UK  –  those  who  are  in 

power, how can they qualify that?  They are hypocrites!  They are taking us for a ride.  They 

are pretending that they are the saviors of democracy, peace, justice.  All this is nonsense.  I 

know,  if  we  go  to  the  International  Court  of  Justice,  we  won’t  get  a  judgment  that  will  be 

binding, but the report that they will make, we will be using it as a tool wherever we go, in all 

conferences, in all countries and even the UN will be blaming them, that they are not honest.   

 

We also, Madam Speaker, support our Mauritian citizens of Chagossian origin in their 

struggle  for  resettlement  in  the  Chagos  Archipelago.  I  am  pleased  to  announce  that  to 

demonstrate  our  unity  on  the  Chagos  Archipelago  issue,  I  am  including  a  representative  of 

the Chagossian community in the delegation that I shall lead in September to the UN General 

Assembly. 

Madam Speaker, the National Development Unit which was dragged into bankruptcy 

by the former Government has been redressed. During financial year 2015-2016, 169 work 

orders for drains, roads and amenities projects to the tune of Rs213 m. have been issued.  

For  2016-2017,  the  NDU  is  proposing  to  embark  on  308  road  projects,  281  drain 

projects and 148 amenities projects.  

The provision of Rs781 m. in this year’s Budget will be utilised for these projects as 

well as for payments in respect of projects awarded in 2015-2016. 

The main challenges ahead for the NDU in 2016-2017 are the revamping of the CABs 

to  restore  their  original  mission  and  purpose;  and  the  introduction  of  the  Land  Drainage 

Authority Bill in the National Assembly. 

 

 

28 

Madam  Speaker,  I  strongly  commend  the  bold  initiative  of  the  Minister  of  Finance 

and  Economic  Development  to  undertake  reforms  with  regard  to  our  public  sector 

institutions.  

He has my full support in this daring endeavour.  

My  office  will  give  the  example  by  expediting  the  merger  of  the  Information  and 

Communication Technology Authority and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. 

As  regards  the  MBC,  I  am  awaiting  its  restructuring  plan  and  in  this  case  also,  my 

Office  will  expedite  matters  so  that  the  institution  can  perform  efficiently,  although,  I  must 

say, the challenges are herculean. 

I wish to put on record that my Office is driving the Metro Express project as well as 

the  Africa-Asia  Air  Corridor  initiative.  My  Office  will  also  drive  the  project  to  set  up  a 

Mauritian National Troupe. 

Madam  Speaker,  undoubtedly  the  2016-2017  Budget  provides  the  country  with  the 

boost it requires to embrace a new era of development. 

It  sets  the environment  and gives the means for  Government  to  function effectively, 

our  people  to  work  in  dignity,  with  resources  for  their  families,  decent  homes  and 

opportunities for their children. It caters to instil enthusiasm in our youth in whom I place my 

unreserved trust. 

It calls upon the nation to be ambitious, to turn today’s adversities into opportunities 

and to look at the future with optimism. 

The Budget has impressively charted out the course to - 

manage our finances in a prudent and sustainable way; 

re-ignite confidence and mobilise the resources of all social partners; 

enhance the ease-of-doing business environment; 

open up the country further to attract foreign investments; 

invest more in infrastructure to spur potential growth; 

embrace technology and innovation to attain new development heights; 

transform Mauritius into an International Financial Centre of Excellence and 

Substance; 

give to our youth the means to attain their dreams through training, jobs and 

economic opportunities; 

 

 

 

 



29 

 

 

 

 

improve our education and health systems; 

accelerate transformation towards an inclusive economy by taking everybody 

on board, and 

strengthen social solidarity and extend our social safety net. 

Madam Speaker, the aim of my Government is to achieve an economic growth that is 

sufficient enough to bring prosperity to one and all. 

We  do  not  want  growth  that  is  only  in  terms  of  figures.  We  want  genuine  growth 

based  on  real  economic  output.  We  want  growth  that  brings  wealth  and  enlarges  the 

national  cake.  And,  this  cake  has  to  be  shared  equitably  and  fairly  with  the  whole  nation. 

That has been and remains our economic philosophy. 

I am confident that we can once more live up to our motto which is “l’économie au 

service du peuple”. 

Madam  Speaker,  there  have  been  criticisms  that  the  targeted  economic  growth  rate 

for 2015/2016 has not been attained.  It is so easy to criticise and when the criticisms come 

from  those  who  have  themselves  inflicted  damage  on  this  country  through  nepotism  and 

other ill-doings, it stirs a sentiment of dismay. 

I share that sentiment. 

We have inherited the BAI mega scandal. And the crash of the BAI inevitably had a 

repercussion on our economic agenda.  It prevented us from going as fast as we could have 

done in implementing our economic vision. Had we not acted as we did, the repercussion on 

our  economy  would  have  been  disastrous.  We  are  lucky  to  have  come  out  of  this  turmoil 

with minimum consequences. 

We assumed our responsibility as a caring and responsible Government in the face of 

the  tremendous  and  horrendous  magnitude  of  the  BAI  scam.  And  we  do  not  fear  the 

criticisms as we know that we are on the right track. 

I  am  confident  that this  year’s budgetary measures will bolster investment,  exports, 

value  creation  and  consumption.  These  together  will  trigger  a  new  dynamism  in  economic 

activity and impact positively on growth. 

Madam Speaker, our challenge today as we proceed to adopt the 2016-2017 Budget 

is  to  see  to  it  that  we  implement  the  measures  announced  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and 

Economic Development. 

 

 

30 

To that effect, I am happy that implementation and monitoring high level committees 

have been set up with deliverables and time frames. 

I appeal to all my Ministers and civil servants to live up to the challenge and to make 

their country their most pressing priority. 

Let  us,  as  one  nation,  private  sector,  civil  society,  Government,  public  sector,  local 

community, everybody, roll up our sleeves and work hard together in partnership to change 

and transform our economy with a new mindset, new vision, new strategic thinking and new 

energy. 

Let  us  start  a  new  journey  together  to  ascend  new  heights  and  cruise  confidently 

towards joining the league of High Income Nations. 

We  made  a  giant  leap  with  the  First  Economic  Miracle;  let’s  do  it  –  again.    As 

outgoing President Barack Obama said it so well “Yes, we can”. 

Madam Speaker, when I started my speech, I said that this budget will be a game-

changer and indeed, it will be. 

This Budget paves the way for a New Mauritius, for a Modern Mauritius, an Inclusive 

Mauritius. 

Let’s get down to work. Let make it happen the way we want. 

Madam Speaker, I wish to express my deep gratitude and thanks to the Government 

of India and to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for the grant of Rs12.7 billion extended to 

Mauritius.  It  is  once  again  a  motherly  gesture  of  India  to  help  Mauritius  pursue  its 

development and modernisation. The money will be mainly utilised to invest in building the 

future of the country. 

Madam Speaker, we have been so many times criticised that we negotiated with India 

on the Double Taxation Treaty.  I must say that those people who criticise to say the least are 

dishonest.   They  are  egoists.  They  are  thinking  of  only  their  interest,  not  the  interest  of  the 

country.  Because  if  we  look  at  the  facts,  over  so  many  years,  India  has  been  pressing 

Mauritius to renegotiate that treaty. The previous Government, the former Prime Minister, he 

did not have the guts, the courage. He did not have any vision. He is blind that chap! 

(Interruptions) 

 

 

31 

Television!  Les  autres  visions!  When  we  have  come  back  to  power,  we  had  to  face  the 

reality. India has already passed a law in India and I was told by the Prime Minister that if we 

don’t negotiate, we don’t come to an agreement that law will come into operation in 2017 and 

that treaty will automatically end. So, what we would have done? Sit down and wait for this 

to happen! When this would have happened, it was made clear to me that there would be no 

negotiation  after  that.  Well,  we  have  negotiated;  we  have  come  to  an  agreement  which  we 

consider is  in the best  interest  of our country.  This  should not  contribute  to  be as if  we  are 

parasites. We must learn to stand on our own feet and this is what this Government is doing. 

Of course, there will be some immediate effects that people may not like, but people say our 

financial sector will die. To hell they will die and they will go to hell, not our financial sector.  

Madam  Speaker,  I end on a quote from  Socrates  that  I find very  appropriate for the 

occasion.  I quote -  

“The  secret  of  change  is  to  focus  all  of  your  energy,  not  on  fighting  the  old,  but  on 

building the new.” 

I thank you, Madam Speaker. 

(11.37 a.m.) 

The Minister of Finance and Economic Development (Mr P. Jugnauth): Madam 

Speaker,  Let  me  at  the  very  outset  thank  all  the  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House  who 

have participated in the debate on the Budget.   

The debate has been very constructive and there have been valuable suggestions that, 

I am sure, will no doubt help us to strengthen our policies and to aim at even better outcomes.  

Madam Speaker, before elaborating on the impact of the Budget, I would like to speak 

briefly about the kind of legacy that was left behind by the previous Government.  

On  the  macroeconomic  front,  all  major  indicators  were  pointing  to  an  economy  that 

was  dangerously  moving  towards  stagnation  at  a  very  low  growth  rate,  with  rising 

unemployment, private investment on a free fall, unsustainable levels of deficits and debt and 

deteriorating current account of the Balance of Payments. The business as well as consumer 

confidence in the economy was at its lowest.  

There  was  rampant  mismanagement  of  our  public  institutions,  with  most  of  them 

accumulating  huge  losses  and  debts  such  as  MPCB  with  non-performing  loans  of  Rs3.2 

billion, the DBM, the Mauritius Post, the Casinos, the MBC and many more Madam Speaker, 

 

 

32 

just  like the  Rose  Belle  Sugar  Estate.    Even  in  the  private  sector,  there  were  companies,  as 

has  been  mentioned  the  BAI  Group  that  was  in  deep  financial  mess,  that  was  absorbing 

public funds in the billions. We have all witnessed the unfolding of those saga during the first 

year  of  our  mandate  and,  in  fact,  which  we  had  to  deal  with  and  to  carry  out  a  major 

cleansing operation.  

On top of all these, there was huge wastage  - and I say wastage in-between inverted 

commas - on the implementation of major infrastructure projects such as the Bagatelle Dam 

with  an  initial  project  value  of  Rs3.1  billion  that  has  hopefully  ended  up  costing  Rs6.2 

billion; the Terre Rouge Verdun project with an initial cost of Rs2 billion which finally, again 

hopefully,  will  cost  Rs4  billion.    And  we  are  still  having  to  spend  huge  sum  of  money  to 

repair  the  structural  defects  on  the  road.  I  won’t  enumerate  all  of  those  projects  that  have 

engouffré des millions et des milliards de nos roupies.  Taken together all these events would 

have,  in  fact,  rocked  the  economy  and  created  a  financial  turmoil.    But  we  have  dealt  with 

them  and  we  can  say,  to  a  large  extent,  that  we have  succeeded  to  save  the  country  from  a 

major crisis and, at the same time, protect thousands of families from financial distress. It was 

indeed a heavy legacy. In fact, the entire development model was cracking at the core and it 

had  to  be  rebuilt.  This  was  our  primary  mission  Madam  Speaker  and  Budget  2016/17  is 

anchored to that endeavour while ushering in a new era of development.    

Overall,  Budget  2016/17  has  been  well  received  by  the  population.    In  fact,  I  can 

recall  few  Budgets  in  the  past  have  been  so  well  received.  The  feedback  has  been  very 

favourable. The Business leaders have expressed their satisfaction and a vast majority of the 

SMEs  and  new  entrepreneurs  are,  in  fact,  encouraged  and  seeing  a  brighter  future  ahead. 

Consumers are now able to stretch their rupee further and our unemployed youths, men and 

women  have  found  renewed  hope  for  getting  the  right  skills  and  a  job  that  will  fit  their 

aspirations. The list is long Madam Speaker, and I will mention just one more - families who 

have been living in conditions of absolute poverty for generations are now finding new hope 

for escaping the poverty trap. In fact, what the Budget does for these families, I have stated 

earlier, is historic and unprecedented. These are probably also the reasons why, just after the 

Budget  Speech  and  today  the  hon.  Leader  of  Opposition  has  said:  ‘c’est  un  budget 

intéressant’.  I could not agree more. 

 

Madame la présidente, devant  les grands défis auxquels  nous avions à faire face, on 

ne pouvait  pas se permettre de rester les bras croisés et subir le lourd héritage qu’on nous a 

 

 

33 

légué.  On ne peut certainement pas résoudre les problèmes avec les modes de pensée qui les 

ont engendrés, comme l’a si bien dit Albert Einstein.      

Il  fallait  absolument  tout  mettre  en  place  pour  bâtir  un  nouvel  avenir  –  un  meilleur 

avenir auquel notre peuple aspire en toute légitimité. 

C’est  justement  la  ligne  directrice  du  Budget  2016/17  –  une  nouvelle  ère  de 

développement. The hon. Leader of Opposition has also said that: ‘il n’y aura pas de relance 

économique’. Of course, on this one - I could not disagree more. But first, let me clear out a 

misunderstanding on the part of some critics of the Budget who have said  - and I heard the 

hon. Leader of Opposition stating it again today in this House - that the Bank of Mauritius is 

forecasting a lower growth rate than the 4.1% that we are predicting for 2016/17. I would like 

to make two points clear on this issue.  The Bank of Mauritius made its forecast weeks before 

the Budget was delivered, which means that it was not aware of the new policies announced 

in the Budget to reboot the economy. The Bank of Mauritius’s forecast was, in fact, on a no-

policy change basis. 

In  fact,  I  have  asked  the  Bank  of  Mauritius  about  its  forecast  with  regard  now  to  all  the 

measures  that  have  been  announced  in  the  Budget.    In  fact,  I  have  just  received  a  note  this 

morning whereby they have made a number of comments looking at the measures that have 

been taken that would be directly affecting the growth rate, I will not go into all of them, but 

just to say and I read exactly so that there is no misunderstanding - 

“Based  on  the  revised  assumptions  and  accommodative  monetary  policy 

stands, the bank staff is culling up its projection for real GDP for 2016 to 3.7% 

and economic growth for 2017 is being forecast at 4% for 2017. 

Well,  of  course,  they  are  barring  any  unpredictable  events  and  based  on  their  assumptions 

that they have taken into consideration.  Likewise, I must say, I am comforted when I see that 

the MCB Focus,  after taking the policy impact  of the Budget  into account,  in  fact,  they  are 

predicting a growth rate of 4.1% for 2017, which is, of course, I would say more in line with 

our own forecast.   

I  will  be  commenting  on  that  later  on.    It  will  depend  also  on  how  the  Government 

behaves  throughout  the  financial  year.    How  much  we  go  about  to  implementing  all  the 

measures that we have announced and, of course, barring hopefully any negative impact by 

unforeseen events. 

 

 

34 

Let me, now, explain how the Budget measures will deliver a 4.1% growth in 2016/17 

and ensure ‘la relance économique’.  The measures we have taken to increase consumption 

and investment, in fact, should give the economy a significant spur on the demand side.  

The Budget also announces a series of measures on the supply side and at the sectoral 

level.  

  Let me start on the demand side -  

(i) 

Government  capital  expenditure alone will inject  some Rs14.5 billion 

into the economy in 2016/17 as opposed to Rs10.8 billion in 2015/16. 

This is an increase of about 34%.    

(ii) 

Overall  public  sector  investment  would  amount  to  Rs34.5  billion  in 

2016/17 and to some Rs97.6 billion for the next three years.  

(iii)  Moreover,  Government  recurrent  expenditure  for  2016/17  has  been 

increased by Rs10.5 billion. Thus, Madam Speaker, Government alone 

will be injecting an extra Rs24.8 billion in the economy.   

(iv)  Madam  Speaker,  this  substantial  increase  in  Government  expenditure 

is  clearly  expansionary.  And  its  impact  will  be  reinforced  by  the 

recovery  of  the  construction  industry  which  has  been  shrinking  over 

the  past  5  years,  but  which  is  getting  a  considerable  boost  in  the 

Budget.    

Our measures to increase demand for residential property includes -  

(v) 

Full exemption from registration duty to a Mauritian citizen acquiring 

a new house or a new apartment during the period 01 September 2016 

to 30th June 2020 for an amount not exceeding Rs6 m.   

(vi)  A  first  time  buyer  will  now  be  allowed  to  buy  bare  residential  land, 

free of registration duty, on the first Rs2 m., provided the acreage does 

not exceed 20 perches.   

(vii)  An  increase  in  the  refund  of  VAT  from  Rs300,000  to  Rs500,000,  on 

submission  of  relevant  receipts,  regarding  the  construction  of  a  new 

dwelling or acquisition of a newly built apartment. This is applicable to 

only  households  with  aggregate  income  not  exceeding  Rs2  m.  per 

annum.  

 

 

35 

(viii)  Allowing promoters, to build and sell residential units of up to Rs6 m., 

free  of  land  transfer  tax.  Removing  registration  duty  on  a  secured 

housing loan not exceeding Rs2 m. 

(ix) 

 And  allowing  non-citizens,  registered  with  the  BOI  and  subject  to 

security  clearances,  to  acquire  apartments  and  business  spaces  in 

buildings.  

(x)  Madam  Speaker,  the  Budget  is  also  significantly  increasing  the 

purchasing power of the population with a series of measures, such as 

by  cutting  the  price  of  cooking  gas  by  20%  for  gas  cylinders  of  5,  6 

and 12 kilos and abolishing customs duty on a number of items which 

at the same time is taking us closer to the duty free island goal.   

(xi)  VAT will be removed on several items.  These include -  

 

 

 

 

Breakfast cereals 

Photovoltaic inverters/batteries 

CCTV camera systems, and 

Burglar alarm systems and sensors 

(xii)  Moreover,  we  are  giving  direct  income  support  to  families  living  in 

absolute  poverty;  we  have  raised  the  income  tax  threshold  for  all 

categories  of  taxpayers  by  Rs10,000  so  that  families  can  have  more 

disposable  income;  and  thousands  of  families  who  make  a  living  by 

running  their  own  micro  and  small  businesses  will  benefit  from  the 

suspension of the payment of trade fees, from tax holidays and from a 

wide spectrum of measures.     

On the supply side - 

1. 

We are putting some 21,400 people out of unemployment.  This should 

raise national productivity while at the same time increase demand as 

these people will have more purchasing power.   

2. 

Significant  investments  are  being  made  in  education  and  training  to 

resolve the mismatch problem.  

3. 

And the Budget gives an unprecedented spur to the development of the 

digital  economy  and  society.  Besides  embracing  modernity,  this 

 

 

36 

strategy will reinforce the economy’s drive to innovate and bring about 

a much needed technology-driven increase in productivity.  

Now, at the sectoral level, the budget is putting a prominent focus on diversification. 

It promotes new niches such as an oil refinery, gold refining and trading of precious metals 

and  bunkering.    It  gives  a  spur  to  bio-farming,  sheltered  agriculture,  renewable  energy  and 

film industry.  

Moreover, we are providing a stimulus package to the SME sector; giving a boost to 

the  manufacturing  sector  with  an  air-freight  subsidy  on  exports  of  textiles  and  apparels; 

fostering new activities in the financial services sector, and diversifying the tourism industry.   

Our strategy also includes an emphasis on economic diplomacy, in fact,  to open new 

markets for our products in countries like Australia, China, India, Russia and, of course, other 

parts of the world.   

Madam  Speaker,  with  these  policies,  supported  by  significant  improvement  in  the 

ease of doing business,  and easier and  cheaper  financing,  we have no doubt  that we have a 

powerful recipe ‘pour la relance économique’.  

In  fact,  Madam  Speaker,  we  are  expecting  most  sectors  of  our  economy,  including 

construction to perform better in 2016/17.  Indeed, we do not expect negative growth in any 

major sector of the economy.  

Thus, Madam Speaker, barring any headwinds on the international front, the measures 

taken  in  the  Budget  should  be  able  to  deliver  the  4.1  per  cent  growth  rate.  And  equally 

important, Madam Speaker, is that with this growth rate, per capita GDP will rise by around 4 

per cent and very few countries in the world can boast of such a per capita GDP growth.   

The average per capita GDP growth rate for the world economy in 2015 was a mere 

1.27 per cent. It was 2.2 per cent for upper middle income economies, 1.3 per cent for high 

income  countries,  and  only  0.2  per  cent  for  sub-Saharan  Africa.    And  it  is  also  manifestly 

clear  that  the  unemployment  rate  should  go  down.  Inflation  has  been  subdued  and  should 

remain  at  a  low  level  in  the  current  fiscal  year  as  well.    And  we  are  hoping  that  as  the 

economy grows at a faster pace, national savings will also go up, that the savings-investment 

gap will narrow down and that there will be improvement in the current account deficit of the 

Balance of Payments. As regards the Budget deficit, our plan is to put in on a downward path.  

 

 

37 

For 2016/17 we are estimating a budget deficit of 3.3 per cent.  Some critics, Madam 

Speaker,  have  mentioned  that  special  funds  should  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  the 

budget deficit and even stated that this would raise the deficit to 4 per cent instead of 3.3 per 

cent.  

Madam  Speaker, this is  not  the case at  all.   In fact,  the Special Funds have a surplus 

which, if integrated in the Consolidated Fund, would further bring the deficit down to 2.8 per 

cent.  We are also putting public sector debt  as a percentage of GDP on a  downward trend.  

And with higher GDP growth and lower deficit, the public sector debt should become more 

sustainable. 

I  should  here  emphasise  that  we  are  measuring  the  total  stock  of  debt  according  to 

international  definition,  but  as  well  as  for  the  purpose  of  the  statutory  public  sector  debt 

ceiling.    And  neither  definition  includes  contingent  liabilities  as  part  of  the  debt  stock. 

Madam Speaker, this is in line with the IMF definition that contingent liabilities should not 

be counted as part of the public debt stock.      

Madam Speaker, with the strategies in the Budget, there cannot be any doubt that our 

country is definitely heading towards stronger macroeconomic fundamentals.   

Let  me  now  come  to  social  development.    Topmost  on  our  minds  while  preparing 

Budget  2016/17  was  the  importance  of  weaving  together  the  economic,  social  and 

environmental threads of development.  

Economic growth cannot and will not be the only metric by which we will judge the 

success  of  this  Budget.  Overall  there  must  be  more  prosperity,  wider  opportunities  and  our 

citizens must be healthier, better educated and able to enjoy a better quality of life.  

Yet,  while  preparing  the  Budget,  we  were  faced  with  some  harsh  realities  when 

looking at the facts and after analysing the views and concerns of those who have participated 

in pre-budget consultations.    

One  troublesome  truth  was  that  about  6,400  families  are  living  in  conditions  of 

absolute poverty as measured against the World Bank’s threshold of Purchasing Power Parity 

USD 3.10 a day, that is, R 1,938 per person per month.   I listened carefully the other day to 

the PNQ of the hon. Leader of the Opposition and again to the remarks. I again say that what 

we  are  doing  is,  in  fact,  unprecedented  because  the  measure,  the  threshold  in  order  to 

categorise somebody as being absolutely poor was Rs6,200.  Let me say briefly, it was only a 

threshold.  

 

 

38 

Firstly,  anybody  who  would  earn  income  less  than  Rs6,200  would,  therefore,  be 

categorised as being absolutely poor. There would be no topping up for that person to attain 

or to reach an income of Rs6,200.   

Secondly,  it  does  not  matter  how  many  people  would  be  living  in  the  household.  It 

could be two.  It could be ten.  The threshold would be Rs6,200.  What we are doing today is, 

first  of  all,  we  are  looking  at  those  families  whose,  as  I  said,  if  I  take  one  adult,  we  have 

increased  the  threshold  to  Rs2,720.  And  of  course  for  a  child,  it  is  less.  There  exists  one 

person in a household and earning less than Rs2,720, we would be topping up to make that 

person earn the Rs2,720.  Of course, there is a limit to everything.   

When we say per capita, we look also at the household. And for the first time in the 

history of Mauritius, we have made a historic change so that, at least, a family of two adults 

and three children would be having an income of Rs9,520. But that is the ceiling. Of course, 

if we look at other households where there would be let’s say three, four, five adults, and let’s 

say five children because resources are limited, we would have wished to be able to provide 

more  financial  support,  but  because  resources  are  limited,  at  least,  the  capping  is  now 

Rs9,520. Now, this is the threshold! 

I should add also that this is much fairer as compared to the actual threshold, where 

we  have  increased  the  threshold,  and  then,  at  least,  there  is  taking  into  account  all  the 

revenue,  all the income that  is  being earned by this  household  comprised of two adults and 

three children.  They would be, therefore, at least reaching that amount. But I must add also 

that this is a programme. It is not just handout. 

As my colleague had explained last time, there is a Social Register of Mauritius. First 

of all, there is going to be a survey, there is going to be a register, and these people will be 

accompanied. C’est un programme d’accompagnement to remove them from poverty, so that 

they are able to stand on their own feet and, hopefully, within a two-year period, we will be 

able to do that. So, that is why I say it is unprecedented. Of course, this is being done with a 

view  to  eradicate  absolute  poverty.  Let  us  see  how  this  programme  unfolds,  how  much 

success we are able to achieve and, at the end of the day, I hope that we will be very proud of 

this decision that is being taken in the Budget of today. 

Another  worrying  trend  also,  Madam  Speaker,  was  the  income  inequality,  as 

measured  by  the  Gini  Coefficient,  which  was  rising.    Many  middle-income  families  were 

 

 

39 

moving down rather than up the ladder.  I found these trends to be seriously incoherent and 

inconsistent also with our status of an upper middle income country. 

Moreover, these trends confirmed our worries before the elections in December 2014 

about  the  social  decay,  about  increasing  poverty,  the  law  and  order  situation,  unsafe  roads, 

the water problem, an education system that needed to adapt, failed housing policies for the 

poor  families  as  well  as  for  middle-income  families,  and  declining  purchasing  power, 

amongst others. 

Now,  these  realities  compelled  us  to  take  a  new  approach  to  social  development, 

starting with two historic decisions, as I have just said. 

First,  to  concretely  implement  the  Marshall  Plan  against  Poverty,  for  which 

Government is mobilising an amount of R 2.2 billion for the next three years. 

Let  me  here  make  the  point  that  Government  has  in  just  two  Budgets  increased  the 

allocation to the Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity and Reform Institutions by 

around 45%, from Rs14.7 billion to Rs21.1 billion. 

And the second decision is to empower the families currently living in conditions of 

absolute  poverty  with,  I  say  again,  an  unprecedented  income  support,  combined  with  the 

actions that I have just mentioned, to take them out of poverty in a sustainable way. 

Obviously, Government cannot do it alone. Social problems are very complex. 

That is why I have come up with a new CSR framework, with a focused approach. 

Madam Speaker, my decision was driven by the need to make more judicious use of 

CSR  money  and  to  get  maximum  impact  in  terms  of  lifting  people  out  of  poverty, 

empowering families, and giving greater protection to vulnerable families. 

During pre-budget consultations, it became clear to us that there was significant room 

for improving the performance of the CSR. 

Madam Speaker, the other day, I did not want to give details about how some of the 

CSR money was being used. I must say I am really revolted when I look at returns that… 

(Interruptions) 

Not to mention any name, but… 

Madam Speaker: Please, no interruptions! 

 

 

40 

(Interruptions) 

No interruptions, please! Please, proceed! 

Mr  Jugnauth:  …  I  am  sure  the  House  will  appreciate.  For  example,  a  company 

giving approximately nearly Rs1 m. to finance… 

(Interruptions) 

Madam  Speaker:  Hon.  Bhagwan  and  hon.  Xavier-Luc  Duval,  you  are  interrupting 

the Minister of Finance. 

Mr Jugnauth:  I am  talking  about  one  case, one  example. Nearly Rs1 m.  to  finance 

certain  organisations  for  their  fun  day.  Again,  I  don’t  want  just  to  give  or  to  mention  any 

name,  but  certain  people  who  are  wealthy,  I  must  say,  have  benefitted  from  CSR  money, 

while there are people outside who are, as we say, in absolute poverty. Forget about having a 

roof,  but  not  even  able  to  have  the  necessary  finances  for  their  everyday  food.  But,  saying 

this, I am not saying that all the companies are like that; have been doing such practices. I am 

not saying that. There have been instances where the money has been used judiciously. There 

are companies that have set up a Foundation where they are doing excellent work also.  But 

all  this  will  be  taken  into  consideration.  That  is  why  I  want  to  reassure  those  non-

governmental  organisations  that  are  bona  fide,  that  are  doing  a  good  work,  that  are 

contributing  to  alleviate  the  suffering  of  the  poor,  that  they  can  rest  assured.    The  CSR 

Foundation will look at their work, will assess, and it is going to be so obvious that, if they 

are putting their share, they are doing their contribution, they will be supported. 

That is why to maintain this status quo was certainly not an option.   We had to act. 

And we did. 

We have no doubt that the new CSR framework will give better outcomes. 

I have said and I want to repeat it again, because I have seen some concerns, maybe 

legitimate  concerns  from  NGOs  that  have  been  receiving  finances  from  a  number  of 

companies.    They  have  been  told  now  that,  with  the  new  framework,  there  is  change  in 

policy.  Well, some companies have decided not  to finance anymore.  That is why we have 

given  them  time  up  to  the  end  of  their  financial  year  so  that  there  is  no  excuse  but,  at  the 

same  time,  those  who  are  bona  fide,  those  who  are  genuine,  who  are  achieving  effective 

results and outcomes in  alleviating the plight of the poor and the vulnerable families with a 

 

 

41 

lot of dedication, I must say, for quite a number of them. They will get the necessary support 

from the National CSR Foundation.    

   

Madam  Speaker,  in  our  electoral  manifesto  and  in  the  Government  Programme,  we 

have  made  a  pledge  to  eradicate  absolute  poverty,  and  so  we  will.    Yet,  another  electoral 

promise that we are fulfilling.  

 

I should here also stress that with equal determination and resolve, we are supporting 

middle-income  families  as  they  strive  for  a  better  life.    This  is  especially  obvious  in  the 

support we are giving them in this Budget regarding housing.   

 

In  fact,  Madam  Speaker,  I  have  announced  more  than  15  measures  to  provide  low-

income  families  with  a  decent  shelter  and  to  support  middle-income  families  as  they 

construct or purchase their own residence.  

 

Madam  Speaker,  while  the  Budget  has  been  widely  well  received,  there  have  been 

nonetheless questions on whether the measures of the Budget will be implemented.  I should 

here stress that many measures have already taken effect or will be in force with the passing 

of  the  Appropriation  Bill  this  week  and  the  Finance  Bill  in  a  fortnight.    For  example,  the 

measures  that  are  already  in  effect,  include  the  price  reduction  on  cooking  gas,  and  the 

elimination of customs duty on various items of consumption. Measures that will take effect, 

with the passing of the Finance Bill, include the removal of VAT, tax reduction on property 

and  other  fiscal  incentives  for  the  purchase  and  construction  of  a  residence,  raising  the 

income tax threshold for all categories of taxpayers, increased deductions for education, and 

most measures announced to support the vulnerable persons and the disabled.  In fact, there 

are  some  58  legislations  that  will  be  amended  in  the  Finance  Bill.  And,  of  course,  we  are 

conscious  that  the  success  of  this  Budget  hinges  mainly  on  timely  and  effective 

implementation  of  the  major  projects  and  programmes  that  require  complex  planning, 

investment and time to be completed.  It is precisely for that reason that we rolled out strategy 

number nine in the Budget, which is about major public sector reforms.   

 

 

Madam Speaker, I said in the Budget Speech, I quote – 

 “The  success  of  the  new  era  of  development  hinges  on  effective  and  expeditious 

implementation of numerous reforms, new policies, vital national projects and modern 

ways  of  doing  things.    To  make  them  happen  requires  a  public  sector  that  is  more 

efficient and that is nimble enough to adapt fast to change. ” 

 

 

42 

 

In  fact,  the  Public  Sector  Reform  Programme  that  we  have  announced  will  concern 

several public sector organisations and bodies and will be carried out after consultations with 

stakeholders. These reforms are a sine qua non condition for providing better services to the 

population,  businesses  as  well  as  to  Government  so  that  it  can  implement  its  policies  more 

speedily,  efficiently  and  effectively.    And  equally  important  is  that  all  these  reforms  will 

allow us to make better use of taxpayers’ money.  

 

I must also add that the purpose of this reform programme, in fact, goes well beyond 

this  Budget.  Let  me,  here,  say  that  every  Ministry  concerned  with  the  Reform  Programme 

will  be  required  to  submit  regular  reports  on  progress  made.  I  will  personally  chair  a  High 

Level  Committee  to  oversee  the  monitoring  and  implementation  of  all  the  strategies  of  the 

Budget.  I will thus personally see to it that the ten strategies of the Budget are implemented 

on time, to deliver the desired impact on our economy and society.  

 

Madam  Speaker,  I  should  like  to  stress  that  Budget  2016/2017  also  shows  the 

commitment  of  this  Government  to  bring  Rodrigues  and  the  other  Outer  Islands  on  higher 

development paths.    

 

Madam Speaker, I will now clarify some measures that were announced in the budget 

Speech.    

 

First, as the House is aware, - and the Rt. hon. Prime Minister has just mentioned and 

commented about this - Government has decided not to implement the Heritage City project.  

And  I heard that a lot are being said  about  the Heritage City project.    It  is good for history 

just  to  recall  that,  in  September  2004  –  in  fact,  I  still  remember  how  Government  become 

owner of the land at Highlands.  It was because we were in Government.  The hon. Leader of 

the Opposition was Prime Minister, I was Minister of Finance.  There was the Illovo Deal; we 

had managed to, I must say, in exceptional circumstances, acquire land and with the intention 

that it would be developed.  And in 2004, in fact, we had retained the services of the Alteo 

Group which came up with a concept plan.  And, of course, because it was on the eve of the 

general  elections,  it  just  remained  as  a  plan  because  we  did  not  have  time  to  go  about  to 

implement the project. And, therefore, the successive Government, the Labour Government, 

in  fact,  carried  on  with  this  project.    I  don’t  want  to  go  into  the  details.  Probably,  the  new 

Members of the National Assembly of the Labour Party would not be aware, but,  certainly, 

hon. Mahomed would be fully aware, because he was in Government at that time.  He knew.  

The former Labour Government had appointed a Financial Adviser, Crisil.   

 

 

43 

The  whole  process  was  being  done  for  so  many  years  and  two  developers  were  being 

retained.  One is Bloom Consortium of Abu Dhabi and the other one is Mahindra Lifespace 

Developers Ltd. of India.  And I remember, I was discussing with the former Prime Minister 

when I did the Budget for 2010 and we included – if you go and have a look at the Budget, 

you  will  see  that  mention  was  made  at  paragraph  243  of  the  Budget  with  regard  to  the 

realisation of the Mauritian Dream; we must invest in it.  This includes the Highlands Project 

which will be reviewed and driven by the Prime Minister’s Office.  It was being driven by the 

Ministry of  Finance at  that  time, but  after discussions  –  I don’t want  to  go into the  reasons 

why, but  I know it fully well -  I told the then Prime Minister that, better you take it, better 

you  drive  it  and,  hopefully,  we  will  come  at  the  end  of  the  road.    But  we  know  what 

happened.   Because of  Neo Town, the whole thing was stopped.   Let  me put  it that way, it 

was  stopped  and,  therefore,  no  project  went  on.    So,  there  is  no  new  idea,  what  we  started 

with  Heritage  City  is  a  good  project  but,  unfortunately,  as  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  has 

said,  at one time we reviewed; there were a number of issues that came up and we decided 

that we are not going ahead.  So, it is not as if it is new.  The Labour Party, in fact, the former 

Prime Minister,  – I remember, I was the Minister of Finance  - only had to choose between 

one of those two developers before the project would be started. That was for the Highlands 

Project.   

The amount now  which  has been  earmarked for  the project,  I can assure  the House, 

that this amount will, in fact, be reallocated to the Metro Express Project  and to that effect, 

we  have  already  made  a  request  to  the  Indian  Government  to  reallocate  the  Rs2.7  billion, 

from the grant of Rs12.7 billion to the Metro Express Project.    

Again, with regard to that Metro Express Project, I think the Rt. hon. Prime Minister 

has given some  explanation, but  to  set  the record straight,  I would also  add to  what  the Rt. 

hon. Prime Minister has said.  I would recommend the new Members of the Labour Party to 

have a look  at,  for  example, the PNQ that was put  by the hon.  Leader of the Opposition  to 

former Minister Anil Bachoo on 18 December 2009, where the hon. Leader of the Opposition 

asked with regard to the LRT, why it has been abandoned and Government is going for the 

Bus Rapid Transit System.  It is very interesting reading, I must say. You go through it and 

you will see. Very interesting!  But I will quote only maybe two parts of that answer where 

Minister Bachoo forcefully said – 

“In the face of these findings, the two options were examined and the balance tipped 

in favour of the BRT system for the following reasons – (…).” 

 

 

44 

A number of reasons are being given. He further went on to say that – 

“It is a known fact that most countries are favouring Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System 

because of its numerous advantages.” 

He informed the House – 

“That  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultant  provides  for  the  latter  to  prepare  the 

detailed engineering designs, that is, the concept planning and design, and the detailed 

designs  in  respect  of  all  infrastructural  amenities,  all  the  civil  works,  the  traffic 

management measures, the relocation of existing services and so on.” 

He goes on to say and I’ll quote only the last part of it so that we do not spend more time – 

“Thus, it can be  concluded that all the relevant  engineering designs should be ready 

within the contractual period and the contract will be awarded before the end of this 

year.  The approval of Central Procurement Office has already been obtained.” 

Madam  Speaker,  in  other  PNQs  and  PQs  that  were  put,  the  Minister  stated  that  the 

cost of the LRT would be, in fact, three times the amount of the BRT. The Bus Rapid Transit 

System would have cost at that time approximately Rs5 billion.   

It is good for me to put on record. The then Government – the Labour Government – 

had  decided  to  go  for  the  Bus  Rapid  Transit  System.    Then,  we  were  going  for  general 

elections.  An alliance had been made between my party and the Labour Party and the PMSD 

as well and I remember very well that a number of issues were being discussed to be included 

in the programme. Suffice for me to say today without going into details that we had been in 

the  Opposition  campaigning  a  lot  against  the  National  Residential  Property  Tax,  a  tax  on 

interest;    the  removal  of  subsidies,  for  example,  on  children  going  for  SC/HSC  and  for  the 

LRT project. I remember the former Prime Minister did not want to go back on these issues.  

He was saying: “Well, it is a reversal of policies. How am I going to face the people?  How 

am  I going to explain that I had approved all this and now we are going back?” Just to say 

briefly, I remember having spent hours at Clarisse House discussing on those issues.  It was a 

time when we had to print our manifesto.  Fortunately, maybe because I had more endurance 

than him, then, he decided, he said: “Well, okay, put all these things in the programme, but 

then we will see.”  This is the way he used to conduct business.  This is how I convinced him 

to include that in the manifesto. 

Amongst others!  

(Interruptions) 

I  heard  a  Member  commenting  that  I  am  against.    How  can  I  be  against  this  LRT 

project? We have been,  not  only us, maybe others also,  but  I  can speak  for myself.    I have 

 

 

45 

always  believed  in  that  modern  mode  of  public  transport  and  that  is  how  I  was  able  to 

convince.  This is proof that the Labour Party, in fact, had already chosen a different route, 

but, fortunately, we managed to convince the former Prime Minister.  I must say that there is 

one Member who referred to a letter that I have written to the hon. Prime Minister of India.  

Yes, I had written a letter and I had made it public also.  It is good for me to put on record 

what has happened at that time. 

When  the  hon.  Leader  of  the  Opposition  had  resigned  –  I  think  it  was  in  2014  as 

Leader of the Opposition – I was nominated as Leader of the Opposition. Je le dis en passant. 

La mesquinerie de l’ancien Premier ministre.  First of all, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for 

India  was  visiting  us,  Mrs  Sushma  Swaraj,  and  it  is  a  Convention  that  an  appointment  is 

arranged  for  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  meet  a  foreign  dignitary.  Not  only  that  Dr. 

Ramgoolam had given specific instructions that there should not be any appointment; he even 

had the guts  to  say that  to  India.  You  can check.  I had talked to  the Protocol  Services and 

you know what the Protocol Services told me: “you know we have received instructions from 

the Prime Minister that we cannot arrange a meeting for you.” 

(Interruptions) 

C’est de la mesquinerie! 

But,  anyway,  I  then  talked  to  India  and  I  requested  for  an  appointment  and  I  was  given  an 

appointment.    It  is  not  proper  for  me  to  say  the  contents  of  a  discussion  that  I  had  with 

Minister  Mrs  Sushma  Swaraj.    First  of  all,  I  did  not  even  talk  about  local  politics,  but 

secondly, I talked about this letter which I had sent to the hon. Prime Minister.  I would not 

say more, but if you read my letter, you will see how can it be that we were going for general 

elections and the Government would have allocated a contract for Rs25 billion!  Would that 

be  convenient?    I  mean  let  the  successive  Government,  whoever  it  would  have  been,  it  has 

been  us.    It  could  have  been  the  Labour  Government,  then  you  would  have  taken  that 

decision, but not at that time.  He was insisting, Dr. Navin Ramgoolam.  I do not want to say 

more, we know what happened. 

Let me say one thing also, why we have taken the stand at that time. First, on a matter 

of  principle,  you  do  not  sign  for  such  a  huge  contract  on  the  eve  of  general  election!  But, 

secondly,  Madam  Speaker  -  fortunately,  I  have  had  the  chance  of  being  part  of  previous 

Governments.  When  I  was  Minister  of  Finance  in  the  Labour  Government,  we  had  also 

carried out a cost estimate of that project.  

 

 

46 

We had also carried out a cost estimate of that project and it amounted to approximately not 

more than Rs15 billion. Then two years after, we hear that the cost has gone to nearly Rs25 

billion  with  operating  costs  of  nearly  Rs1  billion  per  year.  Now  that  is  why  we  said  better 

look at it carefully because the country cannot afford to have such a project at that cost. Also, 

now we are in Government, we look at the project. I will follow what the hon. Prime Minister 

has said for today, but let’s see. I don’t like to anticipate and I don’t like to say things until 

we will receive all the information and the facts, but people will see in the near future what 

was  going  to  happen  because  I  suppose  with  time,  the  project  value  would  have  increased 

normally  with  inflation,  with  increase  in  prices  and  so  on.  So  we  will  see  and  people  will 

make their own judgment. This needed to be clarified so that this thing about we are stealing 

a  project  or  we  are  doing  it,  it  is  not  true.  You  did  not  believe  in  it,  we  are  not  stealing 

anything.  

Again, let me say that the Indian Government has, in fact, agreed to our request and, 

therefore, I will be circulating, at Committee Stage, an amendment to the Estimates 2016/17 

to that effect. However, let me add, we have been discussing with the Indian Government and 

we have flexibility in the future to use that amount to finance other projects should there be a 

need,  but  we  will,  of  course,  be  working  on  those  projects.  Because  we  have  a  number  of 

other projects that are considered a priority and, of course, Cabinet will be informed first and 

then, if need be, we will discuss. Nothing can be done without the concurrence of the Indian 

authorities.    

 

Let me point also that regarding the setting up of the slavery museum project in Port-

Louis, a new site has been identified instead of the ex-Labourdonnais Military Hospital.   

I would also like to take the opportunity to clarify that private banking is not included 

in the definition of investment banking and as such will continue to be licensed and regulated 

by the Bank of Mauritius.  Thus the Banking Act will be amended accordingly.  

Madam Speaker during the debates, there are some issues that have come up. Let me 

comment on just a few.  

On  our  measure  to  remove  the  age  discrimination  regarding  the  Basic  Invalidity 

Pension so that children below the age of 15 years also can benefit, let me point out that this 

discrimination, in fact, has been there for nearly 39 years.  

Therefore, Madam Speaker, it will be remembered that it is this Government that has put an 

end to this discrimination. And I would like to also clarify that persons above 60 years of age 

 

 

47 

and with severe disability do, in fact, receive their Basic Retirement Pension together with a 

carer’s allowance of Rs2,500 per month, therefore making a total of Rs7,750 per month.     

 

Now,  in  order  to  correct  an  anomaly,  the  division  of  assets  between  ex-spouses 

following  a divorce, assets  which have been acquired during the legal  community of  goods 

will be exempted from registration duty and land transfer tax.  

The hon. Leader of the Opposition also had raised an issue with regard to the current 

account  deficit.  In  fact,  mention  is  made  and  if  we  look  at  the  supplement  to  the  Budget 

Speech, at page 12, the trend in the current account deficit is, in fact, clearly illustrated in the 

supplement and it has been reduced from a deficit of 7.2% to a deficit of 4.8% in 2015. Of 

course, I am concerned with the trend that it took going down and down and further down for 

some  time.  We  cannot,  as  a  responsible  Government,  use  or  borrow  money  to  finance 

recurrent expenditure.  

This is, of course, against the basic principles of good economic management, but it 

cannot be corrected at one go, it cannot be corrected after only two Budgets.  I must say we 

are on the right path. The situation is improving and hopefully, at the end of the mandate, I 

want to see that this is positive instead of negative.  

With regard to the impact of the amendment to the double taxation avoidance treaty, 

well the hon. Prime Minister has spoken about that and, in fact, I was also together. We met 

the  hon.  Prime  Minister.  I  had  met  the  hon.  Minister  of  Finance  of  India,  the  Minister  of 

Foreign Affairs. They have all impressed upon us that, if we don’t do anything, the law will 

come  into  operation  therefore,  it  will  affect,  it  will  have  an  impact  on  the  double  taxation 

avoidance treaty and it was mainly in our interest that we do come to an agreement and more 

so,  Madam  Speaker,  we  are  not  dealing  with  anybody  we  are  dealing  with  India;  we  are 

dealing with a country where I do not have words to describe the relationship we have with 

India only to say that it is exceptional. That is why - you know I wouldn’t say among friends, 

among families - what was told to us by the Indian Government is that we should be able, at 

least,  to  come  to  an  amicable  settlement.  We  cannot  do  like  what  formerly  has  been  done 

when  a  former  Minister  of  Finance  said:  Well  India,  if  you  want  to  take  any  steps,  do 

whatever you want,  you do. We will stay put and we will just see what will happen. This is 

not  the  right  attitude.  This  is  a  confrontational  attitude  I  would  say  which  was  not  really 

appreciated  by  the  Indian  Government  at  that  time.  Of  course,  any  changes  will  have  an 

impact. We have to see to it what measures we take and this is why we have taken a series of 

 

 

48 

measures  in  the  financial  sector  to  develop  new  instruments,  to  come  up  with  innovative 

instruments. I can also say we have been monitoring the situation; so far, I must say, there is 

nothing  really  abnormal,  but  we  have  to  continue  monitoring  the  situation.  I  must  say  also 

that  this  treaty  as  it  stands  today,  following  the  amendment,  there  have  been  other 

amendments which India has done with, for example, Singapore, with Cyprus but up to now, 

the Mauritian treaty is still the most favourable treaty as compared to the other treaties.   

Concerning our debt management strategy, we have again lengthily elaborated at page 

10  of  the  Estimates  and  with  regard  to  certain  comments  that  have  been  made  by  the  hon. 

Leader  of  the  Opposition,  I  could  not  agree  more  with  regard  to  the  fact  that  we  have  an 

ageing population  and that  is  why  we have announced also  that there is  need to  be  reforms 

with regard to pensions. Of course, whatever is going to be done will be done in consultation 

with all the stakeholders. In fact, we need to be guidance by expert advice and we will have 

to  come  up,  therefore,  with  recommendations  that  the  Technical  Committee  and  the 

Ministerial Committee will submit to Government.  

 

With regard to debt, yes, I am also concerned.  We have reached a high level of debt. 

That is why we have again taken, I would say a very courageous decision to reimburse before 

time  about  Rs4.3  billion  of  debt  that  was  in  USD.    We  could  have  used  that  money  for  a 

number  of  projects,  but  we  have  to  show  our  determination.  In  fact,  we  have  to  show  that 

there is a will to bring down the level of public debt. 

The  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  also  said  that  les  projets  d’avenir  sont  de  plus  en 

plus  difficile  à  trouver.  Yes,  it  is  very  difficult.  People  are  not  queuing,  in  fact,  to  come  to 

Mauritius just to invest. That is why we need to take appropriate measures. We need to give 

the necessary incentives to be able to attract those people. As the Rt. hon. Prime Minister has 

rightly  said,  whenever  people  are  interested,  they  are  keen,  they  come  up  with  projects,  we 

should  see  to  it  -  of  course,  provided  that  all  the  conditions  are  being  met  –  that  we  don’t 

frighten  them  or  we  don’t  make  as  if  they  are  unwanted,  but  that  we,  at  least,  are  able  to 

welcome them and see that their investment is concretely translated into action for the benefit 

of the country. 

I think that was about what was being said. Well, the last point is, maybe with regard 

to FDI and that is linked to what I have just said. Of course, FDI is also a concern. FDI has 

been  going  down.  We  depend  a  lot  on  the  private  sector  to  invest,  but  it  is  not  only  with 

regard to  the private sector locally. We have to  see to  it that we  open Mauritius and that is 

 

 

49 

why one of the measures that have been taken is to allow foreigners to be able to purchase an 

apartment, a flat or office premises in Mauritius. 

Therefore,  let  me  conclude,  Madam  Speaker.  Budget  2016/17,  in  fact,  focusses 

squarely on the aspirations of our youth, men and women, on micro and small businesses, on 

new entrepreneurs and start-ups, on lifting families out of poverty, and on strengthening the 

middle class.   

We have prepared the Budget with the conviction that every Mauritian deserves a real 

and fair chance at moving up the social ladder and that every Mauritian must regain the sense 

of optimism in the future. 

Thus Budget 2016/17 will be remembered, I hope, as the Budget that -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Had reversed the unemployment trend 

Had restored a higher growth path 

Created a new class of entrepreneurs 

Had shaped the digital economy and society 

Took a historic action to lead families out of absolute poverty 

And,  a  Budget  that  rolled  out  one  of  the  boldest  public  sector  reform 

programmes ever. 

Indeed, Madam Speaker, the Budget sees the future in a new light. 

Madam Speaker, I am confident that our goals will be attained. 

Thank you. 

Question put and agreed to. 

Bill read a second time and committed. 

Madam Speaker: I suspend the sitting for one hour. 

At 12.50 p.m. the sitting was suspended. 

On resuming at 2.00 p.m. with Madam Speaker in the Chair. 

ANNOUNCEMENT 

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY – VOTES – TIME ALLOCATION  

Madam Speaker: Hon. Members, I have to inform the House that in accordance with 

Standing Order 73(4) and after consultation with the Whip, it has been decided to allot time 

 

 

50 

as  appropriate  for  the  consideration  of  different  votes  of  expenditure.  As  we  go  along,  the 

time  allocation  in  respect  of  each  vote  of  expenditure  will  be  announced.  I  will,  of  course, 

exercise  some  flexibility  as  and  when  necessary.  But,  for  the  orderly  conduct  of  the 

Committee of Supply, we will proceed page by page. 

Mr Baloomoody: Yes, we appreciate your remarks, but we have not been favoured a 

copy of how much time is allocated. 

Madam Speaker: But the Opposition Whip already has a copy. 

I will ask the Whip to do that. 

(Interruptions) 

(Interruptions) 

I said that I will inform you as we go along of the time allocation. 

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

(Madam Speaker in the Chair) 

ESTIMATES 2016-2017 & INDICATIVE ESTIMATES 2017-2018 AND 2018-

Vote 1-1 Office of the President was called. 

2019 

Mr Uteem: Madam Chairperson. On page 2 item 22900 - Other Goods and Services 

there  is  an  amount  of  Rs7,925,000  can  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  what  this 

relates to? Item 22900 I just want to know details about what those Goods and Services relate 

to. 

The Prime Minister: Payment for uniform allowances to eligible officers Rs425,000, 

personal  secretariat  of  retired  President  Rs2,000,500.  This  is,  I  suppose,  provision  for  the 

payment of salaries to secretariat staff, telephone privileges, air tickets and other services to 

former Presidents and Governor General. There are three former Presidents and two spouses 

of former Governor General. Hospitality and ceremonies Rs5,000,000, increase in provision 

due to increase in activities for all hospitality offered by this Office including main functions 

like diplomatic dinners, garden party, insignia ceremonies and visit of Heads of States. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page,  Madam  Chairperson,  items  22060  – 

Maintenance  and  31111  –  Dwellings.  Regarding  maintenance  we  find  that  there  is  a  big 

increase of nearly Rs3 m. for maintenance and, at the same time, we are voting especially for 

 

 

51 

this  financial  year  a  sum  of  Rs16  m.  for  the  upgrading  of  the  State  House.  May  I  know 

exactly for which purpose this fund is being voted? 

The Prime Minister: Provision for maintenance of buildings Rs1,500,000, plant and 

equipment  Rs1,500,000,  vehicles  and  motorcycles  Rs1,000,000,  equipment  Rs100,000, 

furniture  and  fixtures  and  fittings  Rs200,000,  for  grounds  and  works  for  the  agricultural 

section Rs3,000,000. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Madam  Chairperson,  coming  back  to  what  hon.  Baloomoody 

requested for the Dwellings there is an amount of Rs16 m. that has been budgeted. It is item 

31111. 

The Prime Minister: Office of the President, the chateau has had to be renovated in 

the  year  2002-2003.  The  roof  is  leaking  badly  and  there  is  need  to  undertake  urgent  repair 

works. Messrs Macbeth Architects Consultants were approached to carry out a survey and to 

make  recommendations  as  appropriate  including  the  preparation  of  the  proper  maintenance 

plan. The repair works to the roof as well as the other associated works are estimated to cost 

approximately  Rs95  m.  The  works  will  be  carried  out  in  two  phases.  Phase  I  repair  to  roof 

leakages  will cost  around Rs17.93 m.  approximately. Tender documents  are being  prepared 

by MPI and bids for construction work will be launched within a period of two months. 

Vote 1-1 Office of the President (Rs84,500,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-2 Office of the Vice-President was called. 

Mr Bhagwan: Vote 1-2 on item 22130 - Studies and Surveys Rs3 m. for studies and 

surveys. Can we have some details?  Page 4. 22130. 

The Prime Minister: Provision to meet the cost of consultancy services, preliminary 

expenses  for  the  construction  of  an  office  cum  residence  for  the  Vice-President  at  Avenue 

Farquhar  Quatre  Bornes  on  a  plot  of  State  land  already  vested  in  the  Office  of  the  Vice-

President. 

Dr. Sorefan: On Page 3 regarding item 21 that is, compensation of employees - I see 

that in post, up to June 2016 we have 10 employees and being funded for this new Budget 15 

new, but I don’t see any increase in salary or provision made for those five new posts. 

The Prime Minister: Well, it depends when they join. 

 (Interruptions) 

 

 

Depending when they were recruited 

52 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  4  item  22030  –  Rent,  every  year  we  are  spending 

Rs850,000  for  rent.    The  more  so  that  it  is  the  office  of  a  Vice-President.  Is  it  proper  for  a 

Vice-President  to  be  in  rented  premises  and  there  was  a  policy  decision  a  few  years  ago  to 

have the house which was supposed to  be for the Speaker which has been abandoned to  be 

renovated  so  that  the  Vice-President  could  occupy  this  as  office?  Can  I  know  what  is  the 

position? 

The Prime Minister: Well, that is so. How can I explain? 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Madam  Chairperson,  on  page  4  on  the  same  item  -  Studies  and 

Surveys may I ask the Rt. hon. Prime Minister if he can table a copy of this study and survey 

which has cost Rs3 m. about the construction of a house or residence for the Vice-President? 

The Prime Minister: It is estimated, I have just answered that. 

Vote 1-2 Office of the Vice-President (Rs17,400,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-3 National Assembly was called. 

The Chairperson: I will take it page by page. It is more orderly if we take it page by 

page. Who has question on page 6? Hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr Baloomoody: On page 6, Office of the Clerk, Operations Officer Broadcast - 2.  

May I know where matters stand with regard to the recruitment of these officers? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Operations  Officer  Broadcast  is  a  new  post.    The  number  of 

established and funded positions is 2, number in post right now is nil and funded vacancy is 

2.    The  National  Assembly  is  implementing  the  live  broadcasting  of  the  proceedings  of  the 

House and matters thereto.  The Operations Officer will assist the Manager of the Broadcast 

Unit. The post will be filled as soon as the scheme of service is prescribed. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  May  we  know  when  we  intend  to  have  live  broadcasting  of  the 

National Assembly proceedings? 

The Prime Minister: It will not take too long, I hope.  Coming soon! 

Mr  Bhagwan:  On  page  8,  Capital  Expenditure,  item  31112.442,  Non-Residential 

Building, upgrading of building, Rs5 m. There are lots of problems concerning this building 

which  was  refurbished  by  the  previous  contractor.  Can  we  know  whether  there  is  still 

 

 

53 

retention  money?    There  is  still  a  lot  work  which  has  not  been  done  properly.  Can  we  also 

know whether there are actions taken against the contractor? 

The  Prime  Minister:  It’s  provision  for  refurbishment  of  the  kitchen  and  the  Lunch 

Room of the National Assembly and purchase of new kitchen appliances. 

Mr Uteem:  Under item  22900.004, Catering, can we know from  the  Rt. hon. Prime 

Minister when would the contract for catering be awarded? 

The Prime Minister: Well, if it is urgent, it will be done very soon. If it is not very 

urgent, it will take some time. 

Mr Baloomoody: On the same page, item 22120, Fees.  Last  year, it was Rs29,000, 

but  this  year,  especially,  we  have  made  provision  for  Rs900,000.    May  we  know  for  what 

purpose and who will be the beneficiary of these fees? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Increase  in  provision  is  for  training  of  staff  and  Members  of 

Parliament in using new IT tools, as the National Assembly is moving towards e-Parliament 

and training of staff working on Live Broadcasting project. 

Vote 1-3 National Assembly (Rs322,100,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote  1-4  Electoral  Supervisory  Commission  and  Electoral  Boundaries  Commission 

was called. 

Mr Bhagwan: On page 9, last line, item 22900.099, Review of Electoral Boundaries.  

We  are  being  asked  to  vote  Rs100  m.  Can  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  give  some  details 

where matters stand concerning this review and how this sum will be spent? 

The  Prime  Minister:  For  Review  of  Electoral  Boundaries,  the  cost  of  project  is 

Rs100,000. 

Mr  Uteem:  Under  item  22040,  Office  Equipment  and  Furniture,  there  is  a  nominal 

sum which has been budgeted.  May I know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister where does this 

Electoral  Supervisory  Commission  sit?    Do  they  have  an  office  for  themselves?    Do  they 

have any staff?  Because there is  no rent,  there is  nothing.  So, where are they supposed to 

sit? 

The Prime Minister: It is at Max City building. I do not know what it is. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Are 

the  Electoral  Boundaries  Commission  and  Electoral 

Commission sitting in the same office? 

 

 

54 

The Prime Minister: Well, I suppose so. They must be in the same one. 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 9, on the first item, 21110.001, Basic Salary, there is the 

post of the Chairman and also members of the Electoral Supervisory Commission. There has 

not  been  any  change  on  the  basic  salary,  that  is,  for  years  2015-2019,  it  has  remained  the 

same.  Why is it that, in the light of the PRB, the salary of the Commissioner of the Electoral 

Supervisory Commission and its members has not increased? 

The Prime Minister: Well, fees are being reviewed, I have been told. 

Mr  Mahomed:  With  regard  to  item  22120,  Fees,  we  see  that  for  the  year  that  has 

gone by, travelling within the Republic has cost us Rs17,000, and then, exceptionally for this 

coming  year, it is going to be Rs700,000 and then Rs100,000 subsequently.  May we know 

why that surge? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  it  is  provision  for  passage  costs  and  accommodation 

costs. 

Vote  1-4  Electoral  Supervisory  Commission  and  Electoral  Boundaries  Commission 

(Rs2,900,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-5 Office of the Electoral Commissioner (Rs73,800,000) was called and agreed 

to. 

(2.24p.m) 

Vote 1-6 The Judiciary was called. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr  Baloomoody:    Can  I  come  back  to  page  13,  the  Strategic  Note.  It  is  stated  that 

Government  intends  to  introduce  a  legislation  to  set  up  a  separate  Court  of  Appeal  and  a 

separate  High  Court  Section  of  the  Supreme  Court.    May  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime 

Minister when does Government intend to come to a proper legislation to have these two new 

institutions? 

The Prime Minister:  It is earmarked for the creation of a separate Court of Appeal 

and a separate High Court section of the Supreme Court. 

(Interruptions) 

Well, I can’t say when.  But, it will done! 

 

 

55 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson:  Page 14, hon. Uteem! 

Mr Uteem:  Madam Chairperson, item  21110, Compensation to Employees, District 

Magistrate, three lines from the bottom of the page.  There is going to be an increase in the 

number of District  Magistrate, from  15 to  25. 10 more!  So, may  I know from  the Rt.  hon. 

Prime  Minister  which  Districts  are  concerned  by  this  increase  and  where  would  these 

additional Magistrates sit? 

The  Prime  Minister:    This  is  a  matter  for  the  Chief  Justice;  he  will  decide.    The 

Master and Registrar!  It is a matter for the Supreme Court. 

The Chairperson:  Page 14. 

Mr  Baloomoody:    On  the  item  21110.001  -  Director  of  Court  Services,  Deputy 

Director  Institute for  Judicial  and Legal Studies  respectively, we find that no provision  has 

been made for these posts.  Does Government intend to keep these posts on the Establishment 

or abandon them because no provision is made and no recruitment also? 

The Prime Minister: Most likely it won’t be done within this Budget period. Well, I 

have just got a note here.  The post was advertised in October 2012.  No qualified candidate 

was available.  Recruitment on contract is being envisaged pending review of the scheme of 

service.  This post is essential to relieve the Master and Registrar from some administrative 

and  managerial  functions  regarding  the  day  to  day  running  of  the  Judiciary  with  regard  to 

Court administration, manpower planning, finance, procurement and infrastructure. 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Rughoobur! 

Mr Rughoobur:  On page 16… 

The  Chairperson:    We  are  proceeding  page  by  page,  hon.  Rughoobur!  We  are  on 

page 14. 

Mr Baloomoody:  On the same page, Judicial Research Assistant, again no provision 

has  been  made  for  this  year.    May  we  know  where  matters  stand  with  regard  to  Judicial 

Research Assistant, which is an important post I must say? 

The Prime Minister:  In its 2016 Report, the Pay Research Bureau has recommended 

the  creation  of  the  new  grade  of  Judicial  Research  Assistant.    Appointment  thereto  will  be 

 

 

56 

made  from  among  holders  of  a  degree  in  Law  from  a  recognised  institution  or  equivalent 

qualification. 

The Chairperson:  Page 15! Hon. Uteem! 

Mr  Uteem:    On  page  15,  under  item  Official  Receiver.  Again  no  mention  is  made 

about the appointment of the Official Receiver who has a very important role to play in the 

Bankruptcy Division of the Supreme Court. 

The Prime Minister:  The post is no longer on the Establishment. 

The Chairperson:  Yes, hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr  Baloomoody:    At  page  15,  item  Secretary  to  Judge!  Again  we  see  that  no 

provision  has  been  made  for  the  filling  of  the  post  of  the  Secretary  to  Judge  and  we  know 

how much assistance a Secretary would be for the Judge. 

The  Prime  Minister:    The  PRB  has  not  recommended  the  creation  of  a  post  of 

Secretary to Judge. 

Mr  Baloomoody:    On  the  same  page  15  with  regard  to  Manager,  Procurement  and 

Supply, again no provision has been made for that post.  It is an important post with regard to 

procurement.  

The Prime Minister:  You should be happy there will be fewer expenses. 

(Interruptions) 

Mr Baloomoody:  This leads to delay in justice.  Justice delayed is justice denied! 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Rughoobur! 

Mr  Rughoobur:    On  page  16,  item  22030,  Rent.  It  has  been  decided  in  the  Budget 

that the some of the court houses are presently being rented. 

(Interruptions) 

Item 22030, Rent. It has been decided that some of the buildings are presently being rented.  

The court houses like Pamplemousses will be transferred to SIFB Building, but I see here that 

the  rent  is  almost  the  same  for  the  financial  year  2016/2017.    So,  may  I  know  if  the  SIFB 

building will host those court houses?  It should have decreased.  It is static there. Can I have 

an explanation on this? 

 

 

57 

The Prime Minister:  I understand it for a transitional period.   

Mr Ameer Meea:   On  page 16, item  22100 - Publication and Stationery.  I see that 

there has been a sudden increase from Rs9.7 m. to almost Rs16 m. May we have the details 

and the breakdown of this item? 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  increase  in  provision  is  due  to  increase  in  publication  of 

notice in newspapers.  Provision also includes refunds of newspapers to Judges and purchase 

of Mauritius Law Reports. 

The Chairperson:  Yes, hon. Uteem! 

Mr  Uteem:    At  page  16,  under  item  22030  –  Rent.  I  see  the  rent  is  actually 

decreasing.  I  go  to  my  earlier  question.    If  we  are  increasing  the  number  of  Magistrates, 

Senior Magistrates, how can we reduce the rent?  Where are these new Magistrates going to 

sit? 

The Prime Minister:  It is because the Mediation Division has moved to Astor Court.  

The Chairperson:  Page 17! 

Mr Ameer Meea:  Under the first item 31112.015 (a) New Supreme Court Building, 

a sum of Rs1.1 billion is earmarked.  It has been announced in the Budget a state-of-the-art 

Court building for the Supreme Court and all its Divisions. May we have some details on this 

project? Will it be the actual Supreme Court that will be renovated at the cost of Rs1.1 billion 

or will it be a new Supreme Court? 

(Interruptions) 

Let the Rt. hon. Prime Minister give the details. 

The Prime Minister: It is going to be built, a new one. 

The Chairperson: New Supreme Court. 

Mr Ameer Meea:  Where will it be? 

The Prime Minister: I think in Port Louis. 

(Interruptions) 

Where the Education Office used to be in the past, at Edith Cavell Street. 

Mr  Mahomed:  I  had  that  question,  but  since  part  of  the  answer  has  already  been 

given, which department… 

 

 

The Chairperson:  On which item number, please? 

58 

Mr  Mahomed:  Same  item,  31112.015  (a)  New  Supreme  Court  Building.  Which 

professional team is going to work on this? Is it going to be the architects, engineers of the 

Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure  or  is  it  going  to  be  subcontracted  to  private  architects  or 

engineers? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  I  don’t  know  whether  it  will  be  private  or  Government 

architect and all that. Consultant will be required. There must be consultancy services first. 

Mr Baloomoody: On page 17, under item 27210.010  Legal Assistance in “in forma 

pauperis”,  may  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  how  much  has  been  spent  in  last 

year’s Budget with regard to that provision and whether there is the intention of Government 

to increase the threshold? 

The Prime Minister: Provision for legal assistance in “in forma pauperis”, legal aid 

is  granted to needy people drawing income not  exceeding Rs10,000 per  month and owning 

property not exceeding Rs500,000. Under the Legal Aid Scheme, expenditure included fees 

as well as refund of air tickets to and from Rodrigues to Attorneys and Barristers, expenditure 

for same.  

For the Financial Year 2015-16, an amount of Rs1,195 m. has been paid. 

Mr  Uteem:  Under  item  31122.802  Acquisition  of  IT  Equipment  –  subsection  (c) 

Revamping of Digital Court Recording System, there is an amount earmarked for this year of 

Rs12 m.  and next  year  Rs13 m.  May  I know from  the Rt.  hon. Prime  Minister whether the 

Revamping of Digital Courts also concerns District Courts or, as it is now, just the Supreme 

Court? 

The Prime Minister: What I see here is all District Courts. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page,  the  last  item  31132.401  Upgrading  of  ICT 

Infrastructure, I find that no provision has been made with regard to the e-Judiciary Project – 

Phase II. There was no provision last year and there is no provision this year, but there is a 

provision  apparently  for  2017-18.  May  we  know  where  matters  stand  with  regard  to  that 

project? 

The  Prime  Minister:  E-Judiciary  Project  -  Phase  II,  it’s  rolled  out  to  the  other 

Divisions of the Supreme Court and to  the subordinate Courts.  It  can only  be  contemplated 

upon a successful implementation of Phase I. 

 

 

59 

The  Chairperson:  I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  that  we  have  already  exceeded  the 

allotted  amount  of  time  on  this  vote  item.  So,  I  will  allow  one  last  question.  Hon.  Osman 

Mahomed! 

Mr  Mahomed:  Yes.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairperson.  Paragraph  199  of  the  Budget 

Speech  mentions  that  the  District  Court  of  Moka  will  go  under  repairs  and  upgrading,  and 

item 31112.015 talks about a New Moka District Court and that to be started in 2018/19 at the 

cost of Rs99 m. So, would the Rt. hon. Prime Minister be able to shed some light because in 

the fourth year Rs5 m. will start disbursement? 

(Interruptions) 

The Prime Minister: Moka District Court has already been constructed. 

(Interruptions) 

Mr  Mahomed:  So,  part  of  the  answer  that  I  am  getting  is  that  it  has  already  been 

constructed,  but  if  it  has  just  been  constructed,  why  will  it  need  to  undergo  repairs  and 

upgrading as per the Budget Speech? 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: You are talking of Moka District Court? 

Mr Mahomed: Yes. 

The Prime Minister: Because it is for the old Court, old building. 

Vote 1- 6 The Judiciary (Rs696,700,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-7 Public and Disciplined Forces Service Commissions was called. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Baloomoody, page 19. 

Mr Baloomoody: No, I’ll go to page 18 first, dealing with the same. 

The Chairperson: Okay. 

Mr Baloomoody:  According to  me, the Key Actions  for FY 2016/17  is  misleading.  

It says Key Action - Timely processing of disciplinary cases by reducing time taken to settle 

cases. And it wants us to believe that the Average time taken to settle disciplinary cases today 

is only 6 weeks and the target is 4 weeks, when we all know - Rt. hon. Prime Minister, you 

are aware - that years and years have gone on and no disciplinary action has been taken. So, it 

is misleading to say that they settle matters within six weeks.  It will be 60 weeks probably. 

 

 

The Prime Minister: It is an average.

The Chairperson: Page 19, hon. Baloomoody. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  We  find  for  the  post  of  Legal  Officer  on  the  same  page,  the  one 

before  last,  Legal  Officer  (New  Grade),  Industrial/Occupational  Psychologist,  no  provision 

has been made.  It was not made last year, it is not made this year and it is not made for the 

future. Will this post be abandoned? 

The Prime Minister: The new grade of Legal Officer has been recommended by the 

Pay Research Bureau. The post is to be filled on a contractual basis. The proposed scheme of 

service is being worked out. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Ameer Meea, page 19! No! Page 20! Page 21! Yes. Hon. 

Ameer Meea! 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 21, the second item 22120 – Fees, there is an amount of 

Rs3,850,000 may we have the details and the breakdown of this figure? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Fees  to  Chairperson  and  Members  of  the  Boards  and 

Committees  Rs200,000;  for  payment  of  fees  to  Chairperson,  Members  of  Departmental 

Tender  Committee  and  Bids  Evaluation  Committees  Rs100,000;  fees  for 

training 

Rs3,500,000; fees to Mauritius Qualification Authority Rs50,000. 

Mr Uteem:  Under item 31112.001 - Construction of Office Building  and then under 

item  31112.401  -  Upgrading  of  Office  Buildings  may  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime 

Minister which building are we talking here and why are we upgrading and then, at the same 

time, constructing? Is it the same building for the Service Commission? 

The Prime Minister: It is provision for payment of retention money. The contract for 

the construction of a new wing for a project value of Rs35,075,000 in the compound of the 

Public and Disciplined Forces Service Commissions. 

Vote 1-7 Public and Disciplined Forces Service Commissions (Rs89,600,000) was, on 

question put, agreed to.  

Vote 1-8 Public Bodies Appeal Tribunal was called. 

Mr Baloomoody: On page 22 Main Achievement for the year 2015/2016 it says that 

51 Determinations and 8 Rulings issued as at end June 2016. May we know how many cases 

 

 

61 

have  been  lodged?  So,  to  know  how  many  have  been  determined,  how  many  have  been 

lodged for that financial year? 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  number  of  appeals  received  is  1111,  number  of  appeals 

heard in which a determination was delivered 450. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  On  page  23  item  21110.001  -  Member  Public  Bodies  Appeal 

Tribunal there is funded position 2 staff. Last year it was Rs1.2 m. the salary and it has been 

budgeted  for  next  year  Rs2.2  m.  and  the  number  of  staff  remains  the  same;  so  why  this 

increase of Rs1 m.? 

The Prime Minister: Why is it double?  

Well, the answer is PRB! 

(Interruptions) 

(Interruptions) 

Mr Uteem: Thank you Chairperson. The item is 21111… 

(Interruptions) 

The  Chairperson:  Hon.  Ameer  Meea,  do  not  make  remarks.  We  are  in  the 

Committee of Supply now, we are not in the debates! Hon. Uteem! 

Mr Uteem: Yes, 21111.100 – Overtime. Overtime has been last year Rs16,000 then it 

will  be  Rs20,000  the  following  years,  but  next  year  it  will  be  Rs300,000.  So,  may  I  know 

from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister why are we anticipating so much overtime for next year? 

The Prime Minister: It is provision for payment of travelling expenses. The increase 

in  provision  is  due  to  revised  rate  of  travelling  allowances  as  per  PRB  Report  2016  and 

recruitment of additional staff. 

Mr Mahomed: A question of similar… 

 (Interruptions) 

The Prime Minister: Well, it is provision for payment of overtime staff and drivers, 

and  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure  and  Land  Transport  for  renovation  work 

done at Belmont House. 

Mr  Mahomed:  Item  21110.001  -  Management  Support  Officers  on  page  23.  My 

question is  similar in  nature to  hon. Ameer Meea’s one.  The salary  for two MSOs was last 

 

 

62 

year Rs219,000 and for next year it is expected to be Rs448,000 which is more than double 

when we know that PRB has visited the MSOs and they have had an increase of about 15%. 

So, there is a huge disparity which, according to me, is not due to PRB. 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: Page 24, hon. Quirin! 

Mr Quirin: Yes page 24, Madam Chairperson item  22060 – Maintenance there is a 

high  increase  in  the  maintenance  fees  from  Rs334,000  to  Rs2,735,000  can  I  know  the 

reasons? 

The  Prime  Minister:  It  is  provision  for  maintenance  of  building.  Then,  of  course, 

there is additional cost for plant and equipment, for two vehicles of chairperson and full time 

member, IT equipment, furniture, fixtures and fittings; it includes all these. 

Mr  Uteem:  On  the  same  item,  the  question  is  about  maintenance  of  buildings.  The 

maintenance is jumping from Rs40,000 to Rs2.5  m. and we know that this tribunal is already 

renting  premises.  So,  the  question  is  why  are  we  spending  Rs2.5  m.  in  maintaining  rented 

premises? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  I  have  been  given  a  note  here;  provision  is  being  made 

for renovation works at the fourth floor of Belmont House. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page,  under  item  22120  -  Fees,  may  we  know  for 

what purpose? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provisions  have  been  made  for  retainer  fees  to  Counsel,  for 

payment of fees to Attorneys and Counsel on a case to case basis and retained to represent the 

Tribunal before the Supreme Court in any case referred to the Supreme Court for a Judicial 

Review. The number of cases for the year is 5.  Fees paid to Barristers are Rs476,000.  The 

increase in provision is due to the increase in number of cases. 

Vote 1-8 Public Bodies Appeal Tribunal (Rs17,000,000) was, on question put, agreed 

to. 

Vote 1-9 Office of Ombudsman was called. 

Mr Bhagwan: On page 26, under item 21110.001, Basic Salary - Ombudsman. Can I 

know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  whether  there  is  a  new  Ombudsperson  or  the  same 

person is still there? 

 

 

The Prime Minister: It is the same one.

The Chairperson: Page 27, hon. Ameer Meea! 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 27, there is an item Rent. There has been an increase from 

Rs654,000 to Rs1.2 m.  May we know why there is an increase in the sum of this rent? May 

we also have some details what is being rented on the floor space area? 

The Prime Minister: The increase in provision is due to additional costs of renting a 

larger office space. 

Vote 1-9 Office of Ombudsman (Rs12,300,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-10 National Audit Office was called. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  29.  Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the 

Director  of  Audit  for  the  excellence  works  they  are  doing.    Of  course,  there  is  a  need  to 

increase  the  manpower  and  I  find  that  there  would  be  an  increase  in  Examiner  of  Accounts 

from 28 to 55.  May I know where matters stand with regard to their recruitment since we are 

already two years in this financial year? 

The  Prime  Minister:    27  vacancies  in  the  grade  of  Examiner  of  Accounts/Senior 

Examiner  of  Accounts  have  been  filled  in  a  temporary  capacity  from  July  2016.    These  27 

officers will thereafter be appointed in a substantive capacity on completion of a probationary 

period of one year. 

Mr Jhuboo: Under item 22120, Fees, there is an increase from Rs1.7 m. to Rs2.8 m. 

for this financial year. Can we have the details of that provision, please? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provision  has  been  made  for  fees  for  training,  fees  to 

consultant, refund of subscription fees to professional bodies, inspection and audit fees. 

Vote 1-10 National Audit Office (Rs157,800,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-11 Employment Relations Tribunal was called. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  31,  Main  Achievements  for  FY  2015/16.  We  know  that 

124 cases were referred to the Tribunal and 224 cases were disposed of.  May we know how 

many complaints there have been in total which have not been disposed or are still pending 

and have not been referred to the Tribunal? 

The Prime Minister: The number of cases lodged as at 30 June 2016 is 124. 

 

 

64 

Mr  Baloomoody:  It  is  written  here  that  124  cases  have  been  lodged  and  the  total 

amount of cases disposed is 224, but it does not tell us how many complaints there have been 

and how many cases they have handled. 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  I  suppose  the  number  of  cases  lodged,  these  were  the 

complaints.  Were there more complaints! 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Out  of  Court,  by  settlement  between  the  parties  in  the  Tribunal 

itself.  So, we want to know how many complaints there have been that they have handled. 

The Prime Minister: How many complaints have been settled amicably!  

Well, we will get the information and I will table it. 

(Interruptions) 

Vote  1-11  Employment  Relations  Tribunal  (Rs24,200,000)  was,  on  question  put, 

agreed to. 

Vote 1-12 Local Government Service Commission was called. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  34,  Main  Achievements  for  FY  2015/16.    Number  of 

disciplinary cases finalised: 48.  May we know how many disciplinary cases are pending? 

The Prime Minister: Well, luckily no case is pending. 

Mr  Uteem:  On  page  34,  Madam  Chairperson  -  Number  of  vacancies  filled:    247. 

Does  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  have  the  figures  for  the  number  of  vacancies  currently 

which have not been filled? 

The Prime Minister: 247 posts have been filled out 595 reported. 

The Chairperson:  Page 35! Page 36! Yes, hon. Osman Mahomed! 

Mr Mahomed:  The LGSC used to have 45 staff.  Now, it is going to have 50.  So, it 

is quite a small department and the building where it is presently operating is  - according to 

item Capital Expenditure, item 31112.801 - going to be extended and renovated to the tune of 

Rs48.6 m. Now, for a small department of 50 people, that figure appears high to me.  So, may 

the Rt. hon. Prime Minister shed some light onto why is the figure so much?  

The  Prime  Minister:    Provision  of  Rs20  m.  represents  preliminaries  and  general 

costs  in  connection  with  the  extension  of  the  Local  Government  Service  Commission 

building’s  second  floor,  the  revised  project  value  of  Rs48,600,000.    The  objective  of  the 

 

 

65 

project is to provide additional office space for (i) Staff and members of the Commission, and 

(ii) archive room.  

Mr Uteem:   On the same page, Madam Chairperson, item  31122.082 Acquisition of 

IT Equipment, there is  a budget  of Rs6.3 m.  May  I  know from the Rt.  hon. Prime Minister 

what does that relate to and whether the contract has already been awarded? 

The Prime Minister:  Provision for the replacement of two servers and 12 PCs which 

are all in use for more than five years. 

Vote  1-12  The  Local  Government  Service  Commission  (Rs56,400,000)  was,  on 

question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-13  

Independent Commission Against Corruption was called. 

Dr. Sorefan:  Madam Chairperson! On page 39, item 26313.026… 

The Chairperson:  No question on pages 37, 38!  Page 39! 

Dr. Sorefan: Recurrent Expenditure, item 26313.026, Staff costs, which is amounting 

to Rs178 m. May we have a list of those staff? 

The Prime Minister: The allocation of the budget of ICAC is in accordance with the 

provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.  It falls within the duties of the Parliamentary 

Committee on ICAC to approve same.  The monitoring of the budget is well laid down in the 

PoCA  itself.    The  law  clearly  provides  that  the  ICAC  has  been  specifically  designed  to  be 

independent  and  that  each  oversight  remains  with  the  Parliamentary  Committee  which 

comprises of Members from both sides of the House.   

Mr Uteem:  Madam Chairperson, on the same item Grants ICAC, it was announced 

in last year’s budget, not this year’s, that there is going to be a Financial Crime Commission.  

May  I know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister whether this grant  to  ICAC which is  already 

provided for three years will remain the same or will be subject to whatever happens on the 

Financial Crime Commission?  

The Prime Minister:  I have no idea!  

(Interruptions) 

The answer is, the Parliamentary Committee will  decide.  When the time comes, provisions 

will be made. 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Dr. Sorefan! 

 

 

66 

Dr.  Sorefan:    Madam  Chairperson,  on  same  page,  Capital  Expenditure,  item 

26323.026, (b) Computerisation Project, I don’t see the project value although we see money 

has been earmarked.  May we know what is the project value? 

The Prime Minister:  I suppose the amount mentioned is the project value.  

Vote  1-13  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption  (Rs211,500,000)  was,  on 

question put, agreed to. 

Vote 1-14 National Human Rights Commission was called. 

Mr Baloomoody: Can I refer to page 40, the Mission Statement is – “To protect and 

promote  human  rights  through  public  sensitisation  (…)”.  Can  we  know  when  the  National 

Human Rights Commission will be operational? 

The Prime Minister: Apparently, it is already operational. 

Mr Baloomoody: The Police Complaints Commission! 

The Prime Minister:  That is another matter! 

Mr Uteem:  Under item 26313.060, the Staff costs is actually increasing from Rs15.9 

m.  to  Rs18.2  m.  So,  may  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  being  given  that  one 

division of the National Human Rights Commission namely, the Police Complaints Division 

has  been  abolished  and  the  work  is  being  transferred  to  the  Independent  Police  Complaints 

Commission, why do we still have to have such an increase in the staff costs of the National 

Human Rights Commission which will have one division less? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provision  is  required  to  meet  the  administrative  and  running 

expenses of the National Human Rights Commission.  The second part, provisions have been 

made for the salaries of the Chairman of the NHRC and the two Deputy Chairperson, Human 

Rights  Commission  Division  and  National  Preventive  Mechanism;  6  Investigators;  2 

Barristers including allowances, bonus and gratuity. 

The Chairperson:  The same page, hon. Ameer Meea!  

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    On  the  same  page,  the  next  item  under  Staff  costs,  Other 

Operating Costs, Rs7 m. May we have a breakdown of this figure? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Regarding  provisions,  personal  emoluments,  Rs11,948,000; 

salary  to  members  of  Commission,  Rs3,311,000;  other  staff  cost,  including  travelling, 

overtime, staff welfare, training mission and capacity building, Rs1,813,000; cost of utilities, 

 

 

67 

Rs350,000; maintenance of vehicles, equipment and building, Rs678,000; rent, Rs2,900,000; 

miscellaneous, Rs3,600,000. 

Mr Uteem: Madam Chairperson, on the same item, my question was to the fact that 

we used to have three Divisions of the National Human Rights Commission.  All were staff.  

Now  we  have  one  Division  less  because  you  have  this  Independent  Police  Complaints 

Commission, which we voted and which has been set up, and there is Rs15 m. earmarked for 

that Commission. So, my question is: what would happen to all the staff, including the Vice-

Chairperson  of  the  Police  Complaints  Division  of  the  Human  Rights?  Are  they  going  to  be 

still on establishment, still being paid or are they being transferred or their contracts simply 

terminated? 

The Prime Minister: Well, I have been given a note. There is still national preventive 

mechanism to Human Rights Division. 

Mr Baloomoody:  Let  me insist  on that.  We used to  have three Divisions.  Now we 

are going to have two Divisions and still we are budgeting the same number of staff with an 

increase, following the PRB. So, we know that one Division will either go to the Commission 

or  the  Police  Complaints  Commission.    But  why  is  it  that  we  are  budgeting  for  three 

Divisions when, in fact, there are two?  There will remain only two Divisions. 

The Prime Minister: Well, when there will be only two Divisions, money will be left 

under  this  item.    In  this  Budget,  provision  has  been  made  for  all  the  three  Divisions.  IPCC 

Act makes provision for the termination of the contract of Deputy Chairperson and members 

of the Police Complaints Commission. 

Vote  1-14  National  Human  Rights  Commission  (Rs25,300,000)  was,  on  question  put, 

agreed to.

The Chairperson: Hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Page  45,  with  regard  to  the  Independent  Police  Complaints 

Commission, Rs15 m.  rupees is  being allocated.  May we know when that Commission  will 

become operative and how many staff there will be?

The  Prime  Minister:  It  has  not  yet  been  constituted.    How  can  I  give  all  these 

information? 

Vote  1-16  Independent  Police  Complaints  Commission  (Rs15,000,000)  was,  on 

question put, agreed to. 

Vote 2-1 Prime Minister’s Office was called.  

Mr  Mahomed:  Madam  Chairperson,  on  page  46,  Strategic  Direction  2016-2019, 

mention is made of a “National Advisory Council” that seeks to formulate and implement the 

Vision 2030 Blueprint, which was produced in September 2016. May I ask the Rt. hon. Prime 

Minister whether a report will be submitted now that it is one  year down the road? Can we 

expect a report of that Council? 

The Prime Minister: I suppose we can expect. Well, in September. 

The Chairperson: Page 50.  

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 50, item 21110.001, Senior Chief Executive. There are eight 

funded  positions  and  it  has  remained  unchanged,  whereas  in  the  Budget  figures,  it  has 

increased  from  Rs8.8  m.  to  Rs14.5  m.  So,  approximately,  about  Rs6  m.  May  we  know  the 

reason for this substantial increase?  Is it the PRB? 

The  Chairperson:  Can  we  take  another  question  in  the  meantime,  so  as  not  to  lose 

time? Because the reply will come.  

Mr  Bhagwan:  Item  22120.017,  Legal  fees,  Rs16  m.    So,  can  we  have  some  details? 

Also, can the Rt. hon. Prime Minister give us the composition of IBA, whether the Director 

of the IBA has been appointed and how? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  payment  of  fees  to  external  lawyers  who  are  providing 

advice to Government on sovereignty matters: Rs15 m.; payment of fees to foreign lawyers 

for  specific  assignment:  Rs1  m.    The  provision  has  been  increased  for  payment  of  fees  to 

external  lawyers.  The  fees  were  previously  paid  from  the  vote  of  the  Attorney  General’s 

Office. 

Mr Bhagwan: May I know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister whether Me Trilochun is 

in the list of external lawyers? 

The  Prime  Minister:  No,  I  don’t  think  so.    I  have  got  the  answer  to  the  previous 

question. Chairperson is vacant. 

 

 

69 

Mr Baloomoody: The post of Chairperson is vacant because the Chairperson is now 

the Director. May we know what is the salary of the Director of IBA who was the previous 

Chairman appointed who appointed herself as Director subsequently? 

The Prime Minister: Well, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, Mrs Washeelah 

Youshreen  Choomka has been appointed Director of the IBA on a contract basis for a period 

of  two  years  with  effect  from  25  March  2016.  Basic  salary:  Rs144,000;  Travelling: 

Rs13,981.50; Telephone: Rs3,250; Driver’s allowance: Rs9,100. In all, it is Rs170,331. 

Mr Ameer Meea:  At page 51, but  just a quick reminder,  I  am  still  awaiting for the 

answer on the Senior Chief Executive which has increased from Rs8.8 m. to Rs14.5 m. I am 

still waiting for this one. Coming back to page 51 for the legal fees, even if the Rt. hon. Prime 

Minister does not have the details, can he… 

The Prime Minister: In fact, it is the PRB increase. 

Mr Ameer Meea: Hon. Prime Minister it can’t be! It can’t be from Rs8.8 m. to Rs14  

m. 

The Prime Minister: Vacant posts, in plural. Vacant posts have been filled. 

Mr Ameer Meea: There are 8 posts in 2016 and for 2017 also there are 8 posts. 

Mr Ameer Meea:  I am on page 51 with regard to item 22120.017 legal fees.  Even if 

the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  does  not  have  the  details,  can  he  circulate  it  later?  It  is  with 

regard to the Rs16 m. for the legal fees. 

The Prime Minister: Yes. 

Mr  Quirin:  Madam  Chairperson,  on  the  same  page  51,  item  31122  -  Acquisition  of 

Fire Fighting Equipment where a sum of Rs5.5 m. has been earmarked for 2016/2017. Can I 

get some details regarding this item, please? 

The Prime Minister: Yes, to replace the old one which is partly out of service due to 

obsolete network cards. 

Dr.  Sorefan:  Item  22900.959  –  expenses  i.c.w.  Africa/  Asia  -  Air  Corridor  Project. 

May we know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister whether this is a new project or it is a project 

which has already started? 

The Prime Minister: Well, it is new. 

 

 

70 

Mr Uteem: On the same item, the fee expense in connection with the Africa/ Asia  - 

Air Corridor Project there is Rs25 m. earmarked. So, may we have details, does that represent 

travelling expenses? Is that fees payable to consultants? What does this Rs25 m. relate to? 

The Prime Minister: Well, it is meant for promotional campaigns in Africa and Asia. 

The Chairperson: Page 52? 

Mr  Uteem:  At  the  bottom  of  page  52,  under  item  22900.901  -  National  Day 

Celebration.  Can the Rt. hon. Prime Minister table a list of service providers and the amount 

paid to them in connection with the National Day Celebration? 

The Prime Minister: I will table in due course. 

The Chairperson: Page 54! Hon. Mahomed! 

Mr  Mahomed:  At  page  54,  under  item  22130  - Studies  and  Surveys.    According  to 

this item the Prime Minister’s Office is going to spend Rs5 m. on studies and surveys. May I 

know what it is for? 

The Prime Minister: Provisions made for consultancy services for electoral system, 

including the new generator for the New Government Centre. 

Mr Uteem: At page 54, under item 22900.928 - Other Goods and Services of which 

expenses relating to Environment and Land Use Appeal Tribunal. There is an increase from 

Rs4  m.  to  Rs19.7  m.  exceptionally  next  year.  So,  may  I  know  what  does  this  Rs15  m. 

increase relate to? 

The Prime Minister: In August 2015, a contract of Rs11,900,000 and a contingency 

sum of Rs450,000 was awarded for the partitioning and associated works to the Environment 

and  Land  Use  Appeal  Tribunal.  The  works  which  started  late  at  the  Tribunal  was  to  be 

completed  in  120  days.  However,  the  works  which  have  not  been  terminated  have  been 

brought in the next financial year whereby a sum of Rs12 m. has been earmarked. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page  54  under  item  22900.932  -  Human  Rights 

Awareness.  We find that the amount has been more than doubled from Rs692,000 to Rs1.5 

m. More so that we have a Human Rights Commission where we have been voting a lot for 

them to create awareness, why do we have to put that much  money  in the Prime Minister’s 

Office for human rights awareness? 

The Prime Minister: The increase in provision is due to –  

 

 

71 

(i) 

study  on  revisiting  the  linguistic  and  ethnographic  approach  of  Rodrigues 

Rs300,000, and 

(ii) 

additional amount provided for sensitisation on international humanitarian law 

for public officers and secondary school students Rs500,000. 

Mr  Quirin:  At  page  54,  under  item  26313.050  -  National  Adoption  Council  from 

Rs600,000 to Rs5 m. Can we know why such an increase? 

The Prime Minister: Which page? 

Mr Quirin: On page 54 item 26313.050 National Adoption Council, we find that the 

sum has gone up from Rs600,000 to Rs5 m. 

The Prime Minister: Government has agreed to the introduction of new legislation to 

domesticate  the  provisions  of  the  Hague  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Children  and 

Cooperation  in  respect  of  inter-country  adoption.    The  National  Adoption  Council  would 

accordingly be restructured into a central authority and staffed with professionals to enable it 

to meet its obligations under the Convention. Hence, the provision has been increased to meet 

the following expenditure – 

 

 

 

 

 

rental of office space: Rs2.5 m.; 

purchase of office equipment and furniture: Rs1 m.;  

utilities: Rs250,000;  

consultancy fees: Rs1 m., and 

other expenses: Rs250,000. 

Mr  Bhagwan:  On  page  54,  under  item  26313.020  Gambling  Regulatory  Authority, 

we are being asked to vote Rs28 m. compared to Rs24 m.  Can we know the justifications of 

the increase?  Can the Rt. hon. Prime Minister later on circulate how much exactly had been 

paid to those who came from the Commissioner of Enquiry on races for the first report and 

for the last report? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provisions  made  for  the  running  cost  of  the  Gambling 

Regulatory  Authority.  The  increase  in  provision  is  due  to  recruitment  of  the  following 

additional staff – 

three Management Support Officers; 

one Accountant;  

four Licensing Inspectorate Officers; 

 

 

 

 

72 

one Receptionist;  

one Driver, and  

purchase of office equipment and furniture for the additional staff.

Mr Uteem: On the last item, 31132.403 Upgrading of Criminal Intelligence System, 

the project is for Rs80 m. with the first disbursement of Rs13 m. as from next year.  May  I 

know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister what does this Criminal Intelligence System relates to 

and whether the contract has already been awarded for the Rs80 m.? 

The Prime Minister: It is provision for the purchase and maintenance of equipment 

for the Criminal Intelligence System and whether it has been awarded, I do not know. 

Dr.  Sorefan:  Under  item  31122.805  Acquisition  of  Security  Equipment,  we  have 

already  spent  Rs178  m.  and  we  are  earmarking  Rs168  m.  May  we  know  what  are  those 

security equipment that we are going to buy? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provision  is  made  for  the  payment  of  the  remaining  balance 

regarding the purchase of security equipment for a total price of USD9,300,000 equivalent to 

around  Rs344,100,000  from  DNS  Consultancy  Services  Ltd.    The  first  payment  of 

USD5,080,000  equivalent  to  Rs178,078,892  has  already  been  made  to  the  company  upon 

receipt of part of the equipment in June 2016. 

The  Chairperson:  I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  House  that  we  have  already 

exhausted  the  allotted  amount  of  time,  but  I  am  giving  two  more  questions  up  to  page  57. 

Page 55!  One last question on page 55! 

Mr Bhagwan:  On page  55, under item  31122.999 Other Machinery and  Equipment 

(b)  Security  Division.  We  are  being  asked  to  vote  Rs8  m.  compared  to  Rs920,000.  Can  we 

have some details on why this big increase? 

The Prime Minister: The provision is for – 

(a) 

Defence  and  Home  Affairs  -  acquisition  of  20  heavy  duty  office 

equipment, photocopy machine, colour printer; 

(b) 

Security Division - acquisition of equipment for the Security Division, 

and 

(c) 

National Security Services - provision for the purchase of furniture and 

equipment.  

 

 

73 

The provision has been increased to purchase security equipment for the Security Division. 

Mr Baloomoody:  May I come back to the last item because it is quite a large sum of 

money,  31132.403,  the  heading  is  Intangible  Fixed  Assets,  so  it  cannot  be  equipment  or 

plants  and  machinery.  It  is  an  upgrading  of  intelligence  system  from  Rs57,000  to  Rs13  m.  

May we know exactly what it is? 

The  Prime  Minister:  It  is  for  upgrading  of  Criminal  Intelligence  System.    It  is 

provision  for  the  purchase  and  maintenance  of  equipment  for  the  Criminal  Intelligence 

System. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    Madam  Chairperson,  on  item  31122.805  Acquisition  of  Security 

Equipment, there has been a sum of Rs178 m. which has already been disbursed and now a 

sum of Rs168 m. is being budgeted. Can I ask the Rt. hon. Prime Minister - if I can catch his 

attention - whether there has been any bidding procedure for this equipment and also may we 

have some details of this specific which is costing us some Rs350 m.?  Is there any telephony 

system included in that? 

The Chairperson: It is item No. 31122.805. 

The  Prime  Minister:  I  am  being  told  that  for  security  equipment,  we  can’t  divulge 

the details. 

The Chairperson: Page 56! No questions! Page 57! 

Mr Mahomed: I have a question on page 57 under item 21110.001 Strategic Policy 

and Planning. 

The  Chairperson:    We  have  already  passed  this  page.    I  asked  but  there  was  no 

question.  So, yes. 

The Prime Minister: Page 57? 

 Mr  Mahomed:  57,  yes.    On  that  whole  department,  is  it  a  Unit  or  a  Division? 

Because  I  have  gone  through  the  strategic  note  and  nothing  is  mentioned  about  it.    We  are 

being  called  to  vote  a  sum  of  Rs12.4  m.    The  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  will  recall  that  once 

upon  a  time,  we  used  to  have  a  Planning  Ministry,  but  that  was  discarded  when  we  had 

Programme Based  Budgeting (PBB). Now that  we have done away with Programme Based 

Budgeting, we do not have a Planning Ministry.  Now, is this department going to shoulder 

that responsibility because in our budgetary framework, the World Bank has just drawn our 

 

 

74 

attention  that  there  is  an  absence  of  planning?    Is  that  Department  going  to  shoulder  that 

responsibility? 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  objectives  of  the  SPPD  are  to  spearhead  and  coordinate 

strategies  and  action  plan  to  achieve  Government  objective  to  usher  the country  into  a  new 

era  of  sustained  economic,  social  and  environmental  development.  This  is  what  you  are 

asking  for?  To  ensure  that  the  policies  of  ministries  are  in  line  with  national  goals  and  to 

provide  relevant,  timely  and  objective  information  on  the  implementation  of  Government 

policy. So it is meant to do that. 

Mr Uteem: Under  item  21110.001 Personal Emoluments Basic Salary. We have just 

been  informed  during  the  course  of  the  week  that  one  of  the  two  assessors  has  resigned 

because, apparently, she was not qualified for the post, Ms Y. May I know from the Rt. hon. 

Prime Minister what would happen whether any claim is being made for reimbursement of all 

the fees payable to her while she was unqualified for the job. 

The Prime Minister: Well I must point out to the House that the previous one was in 

the same boat with same sort of qualifications and she was there for years. After she vacated, 

the new one was appointed and the law does not say that she must have five years standing at 

the Bar. What the law says is: she must have legal knowledge and have been in active work, 

occupation,  activities for a period of five  years.  This  is  what  the law says. So, sometimes  I 

have strong doubts whether she was really disqualified. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  At  page  58,  under  item  21110.005  Extra  Assistance,  there  is  an 

amount of 6.8 million which is budgeted, may we know what are these extras? 

The Prime Minister: Salary to the Chairperson, bonus, refund of leave, contribution 

to  National  Savings  Fund  for  Chairperson  and  three  members  of  the  Equal  Opportunities 

Commission. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Under  the  same  item,  we  found  that  the  post  of  Secretary  to  that 

Commission has not been filled; may we know who is acting as Secretary of the Commission 

now?  

The  Prime  Minister:  One  Deputy  Permanent  Secretary  from  the  Prime  Minister’s 

office posted to Equal Opportunities Commission is performing the duties of Secretary, Equal 

Opportunities Commission. 

 

 

75 

Mr  Mahomed:  As  regards  item  21  Compensation  to  Employees,  we  see  from  the 

table Information Officer. There used to be one and this year we are going to recruit six more 

meaning a 500% increase. And then for Information Support, we did not have any last  year 

and this year we are going to recruit seven. So may I know from the hon. Prime Minister why 

a substantial increase in those two cadres? 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  need  must  have  been  felt  and  it  is  good  that  we  are 

providing jobs for people. You should be happy. 

Mr  Bhagwan:  Under  item  22100.005  Public  Notices,  we  are  being  asked  to  vote 

Rs15.9 m. can the Prime Minister, at least, later on circulate the amount paid to the different 

newspapers during the past financial year? 

The Prime Minister: I hope officers are taking note and they will circulate it.  

Mr Baloomoody: Page 62 under item Capital Expenditure 31112.019 Construction of 

the  Forensic  Science  Laboratory  at  la  Vigie,  can  I  know  from  the  hon.  Prime  Minister 

whether this laboratory will be available for the defence? In a criminal case, can the defence 

have access to that laboratory if they want to challenge the findings of this laboratory? 

The Prime Minister: We will have to decide on that. Well, apparently, the answer is 

yes. Okay the hon. Member is happy. 

Mr  Uteem:  At  page  63,  under  item  22030.001  -  Rental  of  Building,  the  amount  is 

being doubled from Rs2.1 m. to Rs4.2 m. So we just want to know where is the building and 

why is the increase?  

The Prime Minister: Well, there has been an increase in the provision compared to 

the  previous  financial  year  to  enable  the  Bureau  to  run  additional  office  space  to 

accommodate  its  staff.  The  actual  office  space  is  not  enough  to  accommodate  the  staff 

conveniently.  

Mr Baloomoody: At page 64, under item 22060 Maintenance, it has increased from 

3,157,000 to 19,115,000. May we know which building we are talking about as we all know 

that most of the Civil Status Offices around the island are rented buildings. 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  increase  in  provision  under  item  maintenance  of  IT 

equipment  is  to  cater for the payment of maintenance  agreement for the  Central  Population 

Database as from 2016-17 which was previously being paid by the Ministry of Technology, 

Communication and Innovation. 

 

 

76 

Mr Ameer Meea: Page 64, under item 31112.401 Non-Residential Buildings, there is 

question of a setting up of a Marriage hall of Rs5 m. may we have the details of this Marriage 

hall? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Well,  non-citizen  marriages  are  also  being  celebrated  at  the 

Central  Office of the Division, on the 7th Floor of the Emmanuel  Anquetil  Building, in  line 

with  Government  vision  of  promoting  Mauritius  as  a  wedding  and  honeymoon  destination. 

Provision has been made to set up a new and modern marriage hall at the ground floor of the 

Emmanuel Anquetil Building. 

The Chairperson: Yes, hon. Uteem! 

Mr Uteem: That’s discrimination against local! 

The Prime Minister: They won’t have their honeymoon there! 

(Interruptions) 

Mr  Uteem:  Under  Item  22900.009  -  Other  Goods  and  Services  -  Digitalisation  of 

Civil  Status  Records,  Rs10  m.  is  earmarked.  May  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister 

whether the contract has been awarded and who has received the contract? 

The Prime Minister: Yes. It’s provision for uniform, payment of uniform allowances 

to eligible officers and expenses in connection with preparation of the Digitalisation of Civil 

Status Records project. 

Mr Uteem: My question was in respect to that Digitalisation of Civil Status Records, 

whether we have already awarded the contract or not? 

The Prime Minister: Well, I don’t know whether the contract has been awarded. 

The Chairperson: Can we take another question? Page 65. 

The Prime Minister: The contract has not yet been awarded. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Under  item  28211.015  –  Muslim  Family  Council,  may  we  know 

the composition of this Council? 

The Prime Minister: Which number please? 

The Chairperson: 28211. 

The Prime Minister: Page 64. 

The Chairperson: Page 64, yes. 

 

 

77 

The Prime Minister: Regarding Muslim Family Council, provision of annual grant to 

Muslim Family Council established in 1990 under section 29 of the Civil Status Act to meet 

cost of administration and other expenses. 

(Interruptions) 

Well, I have no composition here. 

The  Chairperson:  If  the  composition  is  long,  you  can  circulate  it.  It’s  better  to 

circulate if it’s a long list. Page 66! 

Mr Baloomoody: On page 66, item 25110 Non-Financial Public Corporations, I find 

a drastic shortage in the provision made for Special Rodrigues Holiday Package, Subsidy on 

Airfare  from  Rodrigues,  Subsidy  on  Passenger  Service  Charge,  nearly  50%,  it’s  not  more. 

May we know why? 

(Interruptions) 

There is a 50% decrease in all the allocations with regard to Special Rodrigues Holiday 

Package. May we know why? 

The Chairperson: 25110.011 - Special Rodrigues Holiday Package. 

The Prime Minister: It’s provision for 6 months only. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Osman Mahomed! 

Mr Mahomed: My question pertains to item 28222.024 - Social Housing Programme 

for Rodrigues for which we are being requested to vote Rs50 m. Now, the note says - A new 

Housing Programme will be implemented as from FY 2016/17 by RRA. Provisions have been 

made  to  start  the  programme  under  Vote  of  PMO.  Now,  Prime  Minister’s  Office  does  not 

construct houses. May we know whether it is going to be the National Housing Development 

Company  or  the  National  Empowerment  Foundation  that  is  going  to  be  responsible  for  the 

construction of these houses? 

The Chairperson: You can circulate later. Yes, hon. Ameer Meea! 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Yes,  on  page  66,  item  26321.002  –  Water  sector  development 

projects  in  Rodrigues.  The  project  value  was  Rs75  m.,  Rs63  m.  has  already  been  expensed 

and  Rs10  m.  is  budgeted  for  next  year,  are  we  talking  of  the  Desalination  Project  in 

Rodrigues and, if so, how many plants have been successfully installed and are they working? 

 

 

78 

The Prime Minister: The project is for the construction of four desalination plants at 

Caverne Bouteille, Pointe Venus, Pointe Cotton and Baie Malgache. It is in progress. 

Vote 2-1 Prime Minister’s Office (Rs4,565,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 2-2 National Development Unit was called. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  68,  Key  Action  –  Renovate  the  existing  Citizens  Advice 

Bureau to improve facilities to the public, can I ask the Rt. hon. Prime Minister why is it that 

elected Members of the Opposition are not allowed to use the CAB in order to educate and 

assist members of the public? 

The Prime Minister: But it has always been meant to be used by the PPS. The day 

you’ll become PPS, it will be accessible. 

The Chairperson: Yes, hon. Osman Mahomed! 

Mr Mahomed:  Madam  Chairperson,  I  had  requested for page 67.  I have  a question 

on  the  Strategic  Note  itself.  Now,  the  NDU  is  responsible  to  establish  a  Land  Drainage 

Authority that seeks to formulate, develop and implement appropriate strategies for efficient 

and  effective  flood  mitigation  measures  using  an  integrated  approach  conforming  to  best 

international practices. My question is as follows: why do we need to go and formulate and 

develop when we have so many reports at hand?  

(i) 

we  have  a  comprehensive  study  that  was  done  in  2003  by  GIBB  (Mauritius) 

Ltd.; 

(ii) 

then only three years ago … 

why do we need to… 

Can I finish my question? 

(Interruptions) 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: Let the hon. Member finish his question then I will tell him if it is 

a policy issue, I won’t allow the question. 

Mr Mahomed:  Okay!  In 2012 the UNDP  produced for the Republic of  Mauritius a 

Comprehensive  Inundation,  Flooding  and  Landslide  National  Risk  Profile  Maps  Strategy 

 

 

79 

Frame  and  Action  Plan.  So,  we  have  all  these  documents  at  hand,  why  do  we  need  to  start 

afresh? 

The Chairperson: So, hon. Osman Mahomed, both your questions are policy issues. 

We  are  looking  at  the  Budget  now  itemwise  so,  this  question  is  out  of  order.  Page  69,  no 

question? Page 70, yes? 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 70 item 22030 – Rent may I know why there has been a 

sudden increase from Rs11 m. to Rs25 m. for the rent? Is it the new and comfortable offices 

of the PPS that we are paying Rs25 m. and there has been an increase of more than 100%... 

(Interruptions) 

The Prime Minister:  It  is  increase of office space from 24,000 ft.² to  31,200 ft.² to 

cater  for  additional  staff,  new  rate  of  Rs51  per  square  foot  per  month  includes  service 

charges, fit outs and 15 parking lots. 

(Interruptions)

Grounds/Cemeteries. 

 (Interruptions) 

The trend in Mauritius now is to go to incinerator although we use the old type of burning. 

Can  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  inform  the  House  whether  within  this  vote  provision  has 

been made for the construction of incinerators? 

 

 

80 

The  Prime  Minister:  Provision  for  payment  to  contractors  for  construction  of  new 

cremation grounds, cemeteries undertaken in previous years. 

(Interruptions) 

Mr  Uteem:  Under  item  31113  -  Other  Structures,  may  I  ask  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime 

Minister  if  he  can  circulate  a  list  of  all  the  projects  which  will  be  carried  out  in  the 

forthcoming year for each constituency instead of each one asking under each item where are 

we going to do it. So, could he circulate the list per constituency? 

The Prime Minister: I hope officers will take note and do the needful. 

(Interruptions) 

Mr Rughoobur: Under item 31112.022 - Construction of Market Fairs last year there 

was a provision of Rs80 m. for the construction of a market fair at Goodlands. I just want to 

have confirmation from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister if the funds are still there. 

The Prime Minister: All the information is in the document I have just filed. 

Mr Bhagwan: On page 71 item 31113.018 - Road Safety Devices  Rs2.9 m. Can we 

know  where  these  devices  are  to  be  installed  and  whether  there  is  coordination  with  the 

Ministry of Public Infrastructure and Land Transport, whether it is traffic lights? 

The Prime  Minister:  Provision made for installation of road safety  devices such  as 

hand railing to be undertaken by the National Development Unit. Hand rails. 

Mr  Mahomed:  Item  27210  -  Social  Assistance  Benefits  in  Cash  for  which  we  are 

going to disburse Rs20 m. starting from this year, there was not before. May I know from the 

Rt. hon. Prime Minister what is it about? 

(Interruptions) 

Vote  2-2  National  Development  Unit  (Rs952,000,000)  was,  on  question  put,  agreed 

to.  

Vote 2-3 Police Service was called.  

Mr Baloomoody: On page 75 we find that the post of Woman Deputy Commissioner 

of Police has not been filled last year and no provision has been made for that post. Don’t we 

have  somebody  qualified  at  the  Police  Force  to  be  a  Woman  Deputy  Commissioner  of 

Police? 

 

 

The Prime Minister: There is no eligible candidate. 

81 

Mr Baloomoody: If there is no eligible candidate for Woman Deputy Commissioner 

of  Police  I  hope  that  there  is  eligible  candidate  for  Woman  Police  Deputy  Assistant 

Superintendent,  this  is  much  lower  and  no  provision  was  made  for  last  Budget  and  even  in 

this Budget, even for the Deputy Assistant Superintendent of Police. So, are the women in the 

Police Force not being promoted? 

The Prime Minister: I suppose it is the same answer, no eligible candidate. The post 

of Woman Police Deputy Assistant Superintendent, number of established posts 1. One new 

grade of Women Police  Deputy  Assistant  Superintendent  has been  created in  financial  year 

2016/2017.  The Scheme of Service is in process of being prescribed and the vacancy will be 

filled as soon as possible. 

Mr Baloomoody: May we know what about the Deputy Band Master for music?  No 

provision has been made for a Deputy Band Master.  May we know where matters stand? 

The Prime Minister: Maybe the answer must be same to the one I have given. 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 77, item 22030.007, Rental of Lines for CCTV and other 

Security Network Systems. There is more or less every  year an amount of Rs68 m. which is 

budgeted  and  spent.    May  we  have  some  details  to  which  company  these  lines  are  being 

rented and paid? 

The Prime Minister: Rental of Lines for CCTV and other Security Network Systems 

is  from  Mauritius  Telecom,  MCML,  CEB,  in  connection  with  CCTV  Closed  Circuit 

Television and Digital Radio Communication System. 

Mr Baloomoody: On the same page, item 22060.004, Vehicles and Motorcycles. May 

we know whether the sum of Rs20 m. is for in-house maintenance or contracted out, and if it 

is contracted out, may we know who are the beneficiaries of these contracts? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Since  2008,  Police  Mechanical  Workshop  has  been  closed 

down.  Vehicles are maintained by respective local agents. 

Mr Baloomoody: May we know how these local agents are selected? 

The Prime Minister: How are they?  They are in good health! 

(Interruptions) 

There is quite a number. 

 

 

82 

Mr  Uteem:  Just  one  line  down,  Maintenance  of  IT  Equipment,  a  similar  question.  

Who  carried  out  the  maintenance?  Is  that  done  by  the  National  Computer  Board  or  is  that 

contracted  out?    Because  we  are  talking  about  police  equipment,  very  sensitive  Police 

equipment.    So,  May  I  know  from  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  who  is  responsible  for 

maintaining the IT system of the Police? 

The Prime Minister: I do not know who carried out.  Let me get the information. 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 77, item 22900.001, Uniforms. There is an amount of Rs8 

m. which has already been spent and Rs30 m. budgeted for three years, that is, in total Rs90 

m.    May  we  know  whether  there  has  been  any  tender  procedure  for  the  acquisition  of  the 

uniforms?  If I may be allowed, on the next item, Passports, just two lines below.  There is an 

amount of Rs17 m. for passports, which has already been incurred, and almost an amount of 

Rs25 m. each year for the next three years. May we know why we spend so much money for 

the Passport Office every year?  Do we have a plan to change the Mauritian passport? 

The  Prime  Minister:  For  uniforms,  tenders  have  already  been  launched.  So  far  as 

passport is concerned, there is no change. We do not intend to change. 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: No cross-talking, please! 

Dr. Joomaye: Madam Chairperson, under items 22140, Medical Supplies, Drugs and 

Equipment and 22150, Scientific and Laboratory Equipment and Supplies, may I know who 

is the supplier and has there been any tender for the supply? 

The Prime Minister: I will table the information. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Madam  Chairperson,  may  I  come  back  to  the  item  passport?  If  I 

come back, it is because we see under Capital Expenditure, on next page, Acquisition of Non-

Financial  Assets,  we  are  supposed  to  have  a  project  for  the  Upgrading  of  Passport 

Personalisation system to the tune of Rs108 m.  We used to allocate Rs17 m. and now it is 

Rs24 m, when, in fact, we know that this passport is not given free.  Each and every holder of 

a passport has to buy his passport.  So, what is the Rs25 m. for? 

The  Prime  Minister:  With  a  view  to  enhancing  security  at  our  borders  and  in  line 

with  international  requirements  of  the  international  Civil  Aviation  Globalisation,  it  was 

decided  to  introduce  the  use  of  biometric  identification  passports.  The  project  was

Contributions, there is an increase of Rs10 m., from Rs28 m. to Rs38 m.  Can we have the 

details of that provision, please? 

The  Prime  Minister:  The  increase  in  provision  is  due  to  the  revised  rate  of

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    On  page  79,  last  item,  220260.004  -  Maintenance,  Vehicles  and 

Motorcycles. It is more or less the same figure every year, that is, Rs56 m. which seems to be 

a huge amount.  May we have the details of breakdown and to whom this fee is being paid?

repairs  of  443  motor  vehicles  and  223  motorcycles  and  for  Police  patrols’  operations  and

of Vallée Pitot Police Station.  There is an amount earmarked of Rs20 m. for Vallée Pitot and 

then nothing has been planned for next year.  May I know from the Rt. hon. Prime Minister 

whether the site has already been identified for the construction of Vallée Pitot Police Station 

and the cost of acquisition of that site?

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    On  the  same  item,  Construction  of  Police  Stations,  mention  is

building  is  a  historic  building  and  also  it  is  found  in  the  Aapravasi  Ghat  tampon  zone.  

Presently, as the Police station is being a rented one, may we know for this Rs23 m., where 

the new Station will be situated? Will it be the old one which will be renovated, refurbished

The Prime Minister:  Well, for Trou Fanfaron, land issue is still pending.

Upgrading  of  CCTV.    We  have  learnt  in  this  House  on  many  occasions  that  most  of  the 

CCTVs are not working or are not in good condition, and yet, no provision is made for their 

maintenance.    No  provision  was  made  last  year  and  no  provision  is  made  for  the 

maintenance.  Also, no provision is made for new acquisition of new CCTVs. 

The  Prime  Minister: 

  The  whole  CCTV  project  is  being  reviewed  with

Stations,  the  cost  varies  between  Rs12  m.  and  Rs35  m.,  except  for  the  one  in  Moka  Police 

Station which is almost Rs85 m.. May we know why? 

The Prime Minister:  I suppose because Moka will be the Headquarters.  It is a big 

one. 

Mr  Uteem:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  22120  –  Fees.    For  last  year,  it  was 

Rs35,000; now, we are budgeting Rs2 m.. Does that relate to legal fees or what fees are we 

talking about here? 

The  Prime  Minister:  It  is  provision  for  payment  of  fees  to  the  University  of 

Mauritius and the Mauritius Institute of Training and Development for the training of Police 

officers.  The increase in provision is for the training course of 2015/16.  Provision is made

(a)Offshore  Patrol  Vessel  Rs2,225,800,000,  I  believe  it  is  the  Barracuda  Patrol  Vessel. 

Recently, there has been a breakdown in the ship. May we know whether the repairs are still 

under warranty with the Government of India because I can see that, in the year after, there is 

an amount of Rs41 m. which is budgeted in regard to this vessel? 

The Prime Minister: Insofar as Barracuda is concerned, the repairs were met by the 

company which built the ship because it was still under warranty. 

Mr  Uteem:  Under  item  22060.008  –  Maintenance,  Ships  may  I  know  from  the  Rt. 

hon.  Prime  Minister  how  many  ships  are  concerned  with  the  maintenance  and  who  is  the

no provision for that project. May I know where matters stand? 

The  Prime  Minister:  All  boats  have  been  delivered  that  is  why  there  is  no  further 

provision. 

Dr. Joomaye: Under the same item 31121.803 (c)Acquisition of Waterjet Fast Attack 

Crafts. May we know from which country these vessels will be acquired? 

(Interruptions) 

The Prime Minister: Already delivered from India. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Under  the  same  item,  how  many  vessels  have  been  purchased 

because Rs1.6 billion is the total value project, Rs420 m. has already been spent and more or 

less the same is being budgeted down the years? So, how many vessels are we talking about? 

The Prime Minister: Well two. 

The Chairperson:  Okay, page 89?

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  90,  the  Strategic  Note  with  regard  to  Government 

Printing, we found that the main objective for 2016 will be the Printing of School Textbooks. 

May  we  know  for  which  standard  because  next  year  we  are  going  to  the  Nine-Year 

Schooling?  Will it be for Standards I to IX? 

The Prime Minister: It will be for Standards I, II, III and V. 

Mr  Mahomed:  On  the  same  item  Printing  of  School  Textbooks,  one  of  the  key 

actions for this year will be to maintain the time for printing to 11 weeks. Now, may I ask the 

Rt.  hon. Prime Minister what  are the key  actions being taken because this  year up until  the 

second term, we still had a lot of delays, meaning much more than 11 weeks? 

The Prime Minister: All arrangements are in place for no delay. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Can  I  ask  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  whether  we  have  a 

Government  Printer  and  a  Deputy  Government  Printer  in  post  because  there  was  none?  

Provision has been made; can we know whether we have one in post? 

The Prime Minister: The post of Government Printer is vacant and the actingship is 

ensured by the Deputy with effect from 16 May 2014.  The post will be filled in due course. 

Mr Baloomoody: We know that we do not have a Government Printer and a Deputy 

Government  Printer.  What  about  the  Assistant  Printing  Officer?    The  post  has  remained 

vacant and no provision is made for that post.  Are we abandoning that post? 

The Prime Minister: The Scheme is being reviewed following the PRB report. 

Mr  Uteem:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  31112  Non-Residential  Buildings, 

Construction  of  a  New  Building,  the  project  amount  is  Rs412  m.  May  I  know  from  the  Rt. 

hon. Prime Minister whether the site has been identified and whether procurement has been 

launched for the construction of that new building? 

The Prime Minister: I can read here, it is for the construction of a new building at La 

Tour Koenig to replace the existing building. I suppose the site must have been identified. 

Dr.  Joomaye:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  31122.813  -  Acquisition  of  Printing 

Equipment, there is a sum of Rs15 m.  May we know if acquisition of 3D printing equipment 

is scheduled for this year? 

 

 

The Prime Minister: The answer is no. 

91 

Mr  Mahomed:    On  page  93,  Construction  of  New  Building.  Since  we  are  going  to 

construct on the same site and the printing department is a huge department where is a lot of 

equipment, whilst the construction is going on, where are the operations going to take place 

and if they need to shift, whether there is any cost associated with that movement? 

The Prime Minister: Not on the same site, the site is adjacent. 

Mr  Uteem:    On  the  same  item,  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister  did  not  reply  to  my 

question as to whether tenders have already been launched for the construction? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Request  for  proposal  will  be  launched  for  consultancy  and 

design.  The deadline for launching is end of August 2016. 

Vote 2-4 Government Printing (Rs159,400,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 2-5 Meteorological Services was called. 

Mr Bhagwan:  On page 96, item Director of Meteological Services, can the Rt. hon. 

Prime  Minister  give  us  the  latest  concerning  the  construction  of  radar  for  Early  Warning 

System? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Construction  works  will  start  during  first  week  of  September 

2016 and the project will be completed by July 2018.  

Vote 2-5 Meteorological Services (Rs400,800,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 2-6 Prison Service was called. 

Mr Baloomoody: On the Strategic Note, can I ask the Rt. hon. Prime Minister about 

the  operationalisation  of  an  Open  Prison  for  Women  which  can  accommodate  up  to  20 

women  detainees,  are  we  talking  about  the  Barkly  Women  Prison  which  has  not  been 

operational for quite a long time due to lack of personnel? 

The Prime Minister: Yes, Barkly Women Prison. 

Mr Baloomoody:  Can I ask the Rt. hon. Prime Minister about - on the same page it 

is  said:  “An  Internal  Inspectorate  Mechanism    set  up  to  inspect  prison  institutions  and 

actively  address  complaints  from  detainees”  –  the  composition  of  this  Internal  Inspectorate 

Mechanism? How does it work and how many complaints there have been from detainees in 

the last financial year? 

 

 

92 

The  Prime  Minister:  With  the  assistance  of  the  UNODC,  a  Prison  Inspectorate 

Mechanism was established for Mauritius Prison Service in 2014.  A dedicated team has been 

trained by a UNODC consultant and has been involved in the inspection of the prisons.  The 

objectives  of  the  inspection  are  to  ensure  that  the  different  prisons  are  observing  the 

provisions  of  the  various  human  rights  instruments  and  the  prisons  are  safe  places  for  the 

prisoners  and  the  staff,  and  also  that  a  conducive  environment  for  rehabilitation  is  in  place 

and to help achieve the required best correctional standards and practices. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page,  the  Key  Performance  Indicator,  I  think  the 

Prison Service intends to sign MoUs with NGOs, at least two NGOs.  May we know which 

are the two NGOs which are being targeted? 

The  Prime  Minister:  Rotary  Club  of  Port  Louis,  Terre  de  Paix,  religious  bodies, 

Jummah Mosque, Evêque de Port-Louis, Sanatan Dharma Temple Federations… 

(Interruptions) 

…..Mauritius Tamil Temples Federation, Prison Fellowship International. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  The  answer  is  quite  confusing.    These  are  religious  institutions.  

They are not NGOs.  It is written at page 99, Key Performance Indicator, the number of MoU 

signed with  Non-Governmental  Organisations is  2.  May  we know in  what  specific domain 

these two NGOs operate? 

The  Prime  Minister:    I  suppose  the  Rotary  Club  is  an  NGO.    Terre  de  Paix  is  an 

NGO.  Prison Fellowship International is an NGO and then there is also the Groupe Elan and 

Ki Ou Lé. 

 (Interruptions) 

The Chairperson:  Pages 100-102, no question.

The Deputy Prime Minister: Yes, very much so, Madam Chairperson.  As the hon.

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  Madam  Chairperson,  the  consultants  for  the  Port 

Master  Plan  are  a  firm  called  Royal  Haskoning  of  Netherlands.  As  far  as  the  Director  of 

Tourism is concerned, it used to be called the Secretary for Tourism. Now the post has been 

retitled Director for Tourism in PRB 2016. The scheme of service is being amended to reflect 

the duties, which will be advertised through PSC.  It’s not yet done. 

Mr  Bhagwan:  Page  108,  Madam  Chairperson,  item  26313.089,  Tourism  Authority. 

Can I know from the Deputy Prime Minister whether there are still casual workers working 

for some time, whether they all have been confirmed, and whether funds have been provided? 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  Yes,  they  are  still  casual.  I  think  they  should  be 

confirmed, Madam. They are still contract workers. They have been there for a long time, and 

personally, I think they ought to be confirmed. 

Mr Fowdar: Item 26210, Contribution to International Organisations. Can we know 

which organisation they are? The budget has been reduced to Rs2.5 m. 

The Deputy Prime Minister: In fact, the question came up in Parliament. We are no 

longer contributing to RETOSA. In fact, even the World Tourism Organisation will no longer 

stay there either, because it is costing a lot of money and we are not getting the results that we 

wanted from these organisations. 

Mr Ameer Meea: Page 108, item 22900.949, Leisure Activities. It seems to be a new 

item.  There  is  an  amount  of  Rs4.1  m.  which  is  budgeted.    May  we  have  the  details,  a 

breakdown of this figure? 

The Deputy Prime Minister: Madam, it is not a new item. It was everywhere before 

and now there is a new styling.

Mr  Jhuboo:    At  page  108,  under  item  26313.089  -  Tourism  Authority  (c)  Tourism 

Sites Cleaning and Embellishment Programme.  Can we have some details on that provision, 

please? 

 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  I can circulate the information. 

Mr  Uteem:  At  page  108,  under  item  26313.047  –  Mauritius  Tourism  Promotion 

Authority  (MTPA),  (b)  Promotion  and  Destination  Support  (iii)  Air  Corridor  Africa-Asia 

(Africa Segment).  We have just voted a sum under the Prime Minister’s Office, so may we 

know  from  the  hon.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  why  we  are  voting  another  sum  under  the 

MTPA? 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  It is a collaborative effort.  We have the Tourism, the 

Prime  Minister’s  Office,  the  BOI,  all  are  collaborating  to  increase  traffic  between  Africa 

through  Mauritius  to  Asia  and  so  there  is  some  amount  here  for  a  stipend  also  in  that 

collaborative effort. 

 

Mr Bhagwan:  Under the same item 16313.047 – MTPA (a) Operating Costs.  May 

we know from the hon. Deputy Prime Minister if we can be provided with the list of all the 

representatives of the MTPA outside Mauritius and how they have been  appointed?  Under 

which criteria and how much they are paid? 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:    The  hon.  Member  can  rest  assured,  they  are  all 

appointed through tender, but I’ll circulate the list. 

 

Mr  Fowdar:  Under  item  26313.047  (ii)  Emerging  Markets.    Can  we  know  what 

markets have been identified, which countries they are? 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:    They  are  India,  China,  and  Middle  East;  In  fact,  the 

whole of Africa.  But you can have South Korea also and even Japan.  In fact, new markets 

are emerging all the time. 

 

Mr  Mahomed:    At  page  108,  under  item  26313.089  –  (b)  Green  Hotels  and  Eco-

Tourism.  Before there was a provision of Rs10 m. and now for the next three years there is 

no more. May we know why? 

 

 

97 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  The money was already in the hands of the Tourism 

Authority.  This is why the budget has fallen, in fact.  It seems that it has fallen because we 

got  advance  payment.    The  money  is  there;  we  have  Rs22  m.  in  an  account  and  it  will  be 

spent on that project. 

 

Mr  Uteem:  At  page  108,  under  the  last  item  16313.089  (c)  Tourism  Sites  Cleaning 

and  Embellishment  Programme.  Can  the  hon.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  table  a  list  of  all  the 

sites  that  have  been  earmarked  for  cleaning  and  embellishment  and  also  the  name  of  the 

contractors who have been awarded the contract to carry out the embellishment project? 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:    This  is  done,  I  think,  in-house.    This  is  not  done  by 

contractors.  The question was already asked. I said I would procure the list of what has been 

done.  Or what is to be done, this depends on other things. 

 

Mr  Bhagwan:  At  page  108,  under  item    22900.099  –  Implementation  of  Blue  Flag 

Programme. What about it? 

 

 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  It is in Albion or it is coming up? 

The Chairperson: Page 109! 

Mr Bhagwan: Page 109, under item 31113.431 – Zoning of Lagoons.  Has the site 

been identified?  Can we have some details, please? 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  Zoning of lagoons are done all the time; now we have  

zone  lagoons  where  there  are  diving  sites,  zone  lagoons  where  we  have  swimming  areas, 

zone lagoons at Mont Choisy for boats; Pereybere also and coming up now at Flic-à-Flac. 

 

Mr  Bhagwan:    At  page  109,  under  item  3113.016  –  Construction  of  Touristic  and 

Leisure  Infrastructure  -Tourism  Signage.    Can  we  know  from  the  hon.  Deputy  Prime 

Minister  whether  a  survey  has  been  done  concerning  the  signage  already  fixed  and  those 

which  are  missing,  and  whether  there  are  new  types  of  signage  which  are  being  installed 

following a recent survey, because there are new places, especially inside Mauritius? 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  We should have a new signage project.  However, the 

signage products were expensive, but they lasted well.  And we have Rs1 m. in our budget to 

maintain and revamp them.   

 

Mr Uteem:  At page 109, under item 31113.416 – upgrading of Touristic and Leisure 

Infrastructure.  It is a Rs25 m. project; Rs5 m. is earmarked as from next year.  So, may we 

have a list of what touristic and leisure infrastructure are being upgraded? 

 

 

98 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  We have not really succeeded in getting the Citadelle 

waterproof.  So, we still have work to do there; basically, the strategies.  It is Rs5 m. anyway, 

not Rs25 m. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vote 3-1 Tourism (Rs727,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 3-2 External Communications was called. 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Baloomoody! 

Mr Baloomoody:  Which page are we? 

The Chairperson:  We are at page 110. 

Mr Baloomoody:  I will come to page 111 then. 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Ameer Meea! Page 110!  No question? Page 111? 

Mr Baloomoody: Under Item 2210.008 – Fees to Consultants.  I see that an amount 

of Rs12 m. is earmarked.  May we know for which project?  And who is the beneficiary of 

this contract? 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  This is a grant that we have received from the Agence 

Française  de  Dévéloppement  and  it  is  to  study  productivity  at  the  Cargo  Handling 

Corporation, if my memory serves me right.  I will just check that.  Yes, that’s what it is. 

 

Mr  Baloomoody:    Rs8  m  is  provided  for  next  year,  so  the  consultant  fees  are 

annually then? 

 

 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  We have  Rs8 m. for next year. 

Mr Ameer Meea:  At page 111, under item 32145.120  – Loans to Cargo Handling 

Corporation Ltd.  There is an amount of Rs250,000.  May we know the terms and conditions 

of this loan? 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:    The  loan  is  from  the  Agence  Française  de 

Dévéloppement for the purchase of equipment  for Cargo Handling Corporation  Ltd.    I have 

no problem to provide the terms and conditions. 

 

Mr Uteem:  Still under the Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd., may we know from the 

hon. Deputy Prime Minister where matters stand with respect to the strategic partner for that 

Corporation? 

 

 

99 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:    I  mentioned  this  in  my  speech;,  with  regard  to  DP 

World, we are still talking to them.  We have some matters still in contention, but we are still 

talking to them. 

 

Mr Ameer Meea:  On the same issue of Loan to Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd., I 

believe,  as  the  hon.  Deputy  Prime  Minister  stated,  that  it  is  a  loan  from  AFD.  Is  it  a 

repayment, because Rs250,000 is being budgeted in 2017/18? 

 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  I  am  answering  for  2016/17.    For  2017/18,  I  don’t 

know, I need to have the information.  But the loan that comes in will come in for the revenue 

of  the  Government  and  it  is  being  spent  here  so  that  you  have  transparency,  otherwise  you 

will not see the amount being spent at all. So, it comes in and goes out. 

I am told it is Rs500 m. for over two years.  Sorry about that! 

(Interruptions) 

Mr  Fowdar:    Can  I  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 

loan?  Are they repayable with interest?  Is there a time frame for repayment? 

The Deputy Prime Minister: I will circulate the information for the House. 

Vote 3-2 External Communications (Rs284,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 3-3 Civil Aviation was called. 

Mr Uteem: On page 112, under item 21110 Personal Emoluments - Director of Civil 

Aviation,  may  I  know  from  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  whether  this  position  of  Director  of 

Civil Aviation has been filled, and if so, who is the incumbent? 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  We  have  a  Director  of  Civil  Aviation  and  it  is  Mr 

Pokhun. 

Mr Rughoobur: Under item 22120.020, Inspection and Audit Fees, may I know from 

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  if  there  is  any  amount  earmarked  for  inspection  in  terms  of 

security.    Can  he  give  some  details  on  the  amount  being  paid  and  the  firm  selected  for  the 

exercise? 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  The  current  contracts  for  technical  assistance  with 

Bureau Veritas and UK Civil Aviation Authority will lapse in December 2016. The increase 

in tender value is estimated to be between 20% and 25%.  Provision also includes oversight 

for  three  new  helicopter  operators.  A  sum  of  Rs2  m.  is  earmarked  for  the  Department’s 

 

 

100 

oversight activities to be undertaken abroad where Air Mauritius and other aircrafts registered 

with the Department are maintained.  Inspections and Audits are undertaken by the inspectors 

of the Department. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  On  page  114,  under  the  last  item,  22900  Other  Goods  and 

Services, there is an amount of Rs6.7 m. May we have the details for this amount? 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  Provision  is  made  for  the  payment  of  uniforms, 

satellite  communication  service  charges  and  purchase  of  aviation  security  identification 

cards. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  22120  Fees,  we  have  fees  for 

training.  It  is  Rs9  m.  this  year  and  Rs9  m.  next  year.    Are  we  having  new  recruits  that  we 

have to train? 

The  Deputy  Prime  Minister:  It  is  increase  to  cater  for  training  of  newly  appointed 

staff,  consultancy  fee  for  the  setting  up  of  Civil  Aviation  Authority,  technical  assistance  in 

airworthiness and flight operation.  Tender exercise will be launched in September 2016. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Coming  back  to  Inspection  and  Audit  Fees.  There  has  been  an 

increase from Rs36 m. to Rs47.5 m., that is, Rs11 m.  May we know the reason why such an 

increase? 

Mr  Mahomed:  On  the  same  subject,  who  does  the  inspection  and  audit?    Is  it 

outsourced or is it done internally? 

The Deputy Prime Minister: I presume it is increasing because we have more audits 

to  do.    We  do  charge  for  this.    It  is  not  free  when  we  do  it  for  Air  Mauritius  or  other 

registered  aircraft,  we  charge  for  it.    We  do  it  in  conjunction  with  Bureau  Veritas  and  UK 

Civil Aviation Authority. 

Mr  Uteem:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  31122.999  (c)  Replacement  of  Very 

Small  Aperture  Terminal  (VSAT)/VHF  Amplitude  Modulation  equipment,  there  is  a  project 

amount of Rs110 m.  May I know from the Deputy Prime Minister whether the contract has 

already been awarded and to whom it has been awarded? 

The Deputy Prime Minister: It is not yet awarded. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    On  the  same  issue,  may  we  have  some  details  on  this  item  of 

Rs110 m.  What is this item? 

 

 

101 

The Deputy Prime Minister:  The (VSAT)/VHF, AM radio  equipment  form  part of 

the  communication  system  for  providing  voice  communication  between  Air  Traffic 

Controllers  and  Pilots  and  voice  and  data  with  adjacent  Air  Traffic  Control  Centre.    The 

VSAT  are  ground  based  satellite  communication  equipment  installed  in  Mauritius, 

Rodrigues,  Agalega  and  St  Brandon  which  are  used  with  a  VHF  AM  radio  equipment  to 

extend the radio range of the VHF AM for the provision of Air Traffic Services. 

Dr.  Joomaye:  Madam  Chairperson,  one  item  below,  31122.999    (d)  Airspace 

Restructuring,  can  we  have  some  details  about  this  item  as  there  is  an  amount  of  Rs17  m. 

voted and Rs1 m. to be spent this year? 

The Deputy Prime Minister: The existing airspace will be redesigned to ensure the 

use of modern satellite technology in line with ICAO performance based navigation concept.  

This  will  cater  for  future  air  traffic  demand  and  performance  requirements  in  terms  of 

capacity and flight efficiency in a cost effective manner. A new routing will be published for 

use by pilots. 

Vote 3-3 Civil Aviation (Rs346,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 4-1 Vice-Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Housing and Lands was called.

constructed and delivered in the last financial year? 

Mr Soodhun:  It  is  about  1,000.  I have a long  list.    If the hon. Member  wants  I  can 

circulate it, or if he wants, I can read it –

Mr  Baloomoody:  I  am  asking  about  those  which  have  been  constructed  and 

delivered. 

Mr Soodhun: Let me start again – 

 

 

Henrietta - the starting date is January 2014 and completed in March 2015 

Quatre Cocos - the starting date is June 2014 and completed in June 2016. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Madam  Chairperson,  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  cannot  waste 

the time of the House because our time is limited. 

Mr Soodhun: But you are asking… 

Mr  Baloomoody:  My  question  is:  how  many  you  have  delivered,  not  completed  or 

constructed. 

Mr Soodhun: There is a long list.  If the hon. Member wants, I can circulate it. 

The Chairperson:  You can circulate it later.   

Mr  Mahomed:    On  the  same  item,  Main  Achievements  for  2015/2016,  mention  is 

made that 345 families have become owners of the plot of State land on which stand their ex-

CHA housing units.  Now, we all know that there are 19,500 ex-CHA houses in the country 

for which they are all entitled to purchase their land at Rs2,000. So, 345 over 19,500 is not a 

big  achievement  unless  this  is  the  last  batch.    Can  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  confirm 

whether this is a last batch or is it still ongoing? 

Mr  Soodhun:  The  345  families  have  become  owners  of  the  plot  of  State  land  on 

which there are ex-CHA housing units.   

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  On  page  116,  there  is  a  Debt  Recovery  Unit  in  place  since 

February 2015 to recoup arrears payment of rentals plus interest resulting in arrears collection 

of Rs114 m., but mention here is not made of the extent of land that has been recouped, that 

has been retrieved back from previous owners. I believe from a PQ here in the House, there 

 

 

103 

was a unit that was set up to retrieve those lands.  So, may we have the details of lands that 

have been retrieved back? 

Mr Soodhun:  Madam Chairperson, I can circulate it.  There is no problem for that. 

Mr Mahomed:  Key Actions for FY 2016/2017, Preparation of Topographic maps to 

help in Disaster Risk Management.  Now, what kind of disasters are we talking about because 

we already have maps for inundation, flooding and landslide? Is there any additional disaster 

that we are looking at here? 

Mr Soodhun:  In fact, we are talking about disaster when we have this case of heavy 

rains  and  so  on.  There  are  a  few  cases  where  a  topography  map  is  needed.    Now,  it  is 

updated. 

Mr  Bhagwan:    We  have  been  told:  “Completion  of  rehabilitation  works  in  NHDC 

Housing  Estates  to  improve  living  condition  of  residents”.    We  are  being  informed  that  six 

units  have  been  completely  rehabilitated.    Can  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  give  us  which 

are the six housing estates which have been rehabilitated? 

Mr Soodhun: Beau Vallon, La Tour Koenig, Camp le Vieux, Cité La Cure… 

Riche Terre, Vallée des Prêtres.  I will circulate it, no problem. 

(Interruptions) 

Mr Ameer Meea: On page 119, item 22030 –Rent, there has been a massive increase 

from Rs12 m. to Rs26.6 m. May we know the reason why there is such an increase and also 

can we have the details of which property is being rented, where and its extent area. 

Mr Soodhun:  In fact, Madam Chairperson, provision from the Vote sub-head 4102 

and 4103 have been transferred to vote sub 4101 as the monthly rent of Rs2,201,522.  In the 

past it was separate.  It was three different votes. The votes have been brought to one vote.  It 

was in the same buildings with three different votes: (1) General; (2) Housing and (3) Survey 

Department.   So, the General  was Rs12,383,000; the Housing  floor was  Rs719,000 and the 

Survey Planning, Rs13,984,000.  The total is Rs27,086,000. 

Mr Uteem:   Item 21111.100, Other Staff Costs, Overtime, last  year it was Rs3.3 m, 

this  year  it  will  be  Rs2.5  m.  and  next  year  Rs2.5.    Why  do  we  pay  so  much  money  in 

overtime? 

 

 

104 

Mr Soodhun:  It is for travelling allowance, travel grant, refund of bus fare, staff fare 

and overtime based on actual expenditure. 

The Chairperson:  Why overtime? 

Mr Soodhun:  They have changed all the procedures as they were in the past.  So, we 

have  asked  staff  to  come  to  work  on  Saturday  to  complete  certain  surveys  in  which  there 

were backlogs.  

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  On  page  119,  item  21110.005-  Extra  Assistance.    There  is  an 

amount Rs5.6 m. May we know what is this ‘Extra Assistance’? 

Mr Soodhun:  Payment: salaries and allowance to four advisers. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  May  we  have  a  breakdown  of  this  figure  of  the  salaries  of  these 

advisers? 

Mr Soodhun:  I can circulate it. 

The Chairperson:  Page 120!  Yes, hon. Uteem! 

Mr  Uteem:    Item  31132.401  -  Intangible  Fixed  Assets,  Upgrading  of  ICT 

Infrastructure. May I know from the hon. Vice-Prime Minister what this relates to and who 

was awarded the contract? 

Mr  Soodhun:  It  is  the  upgrading  of  ICT  instructions  of  the  existing  computerised 

system  that  hosts  the  review  model;  payment  of  rental  by  register  system  and  the  store 

application has to  be  replaced at  the earliest  possible in  all system  - hardware  and software 

which  is  often  encountering  technical  problems.    The  Central  Informatics  Bureau  has 

submitted  the  amendment  specification  and  requested  the  clearance  from  the  Ministry  of 

Civil  Service  and  Administrative  Reforms  regarding 

the  development  of  separate 

computerised register system.  The view is still awaited.  

The payment schedule of the project  after consultation  with  the Ministry  of Finance 

and Economic Development Rs9.25m. to be paid in this Financial Year; Rs25 m. to be paid 

in 2017/18. Maintenance cost of existing system is Rs272,846,053  for the period of 07 June 

2016 to 06 June 2017 and for the hardware Rs448,552.31 VAT exclusive for the Grade 1 for 

the period January 2016 to 31 December 2016. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Mahomed! 

 

 

105 

Mr  Mahomed:  Under  item  21110.001  -  Housing  Development  Officer,  for  the  last 

Financial  Year,  we  had  one  and  it  cost  us  Rs576,000.    In  this  current  year  we  are  going  to 

recruit  a  total  of  three  more  making  it  four  and  the  total  sum  required  for  this  will  be 

Rs992,000.  So,  to  my  view,  it  is  not  proportionate.  Can  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  shed 

some light on this figure? 

Mr  Soodhun:  It  depends  when  we  are  going  to  recruit  because  other  vacancies  in 

respect  of  Housing  Development  Officer  have  been  advertised  on  14  July.  The  selection 

exercise is scheduled by the PSC for 31 August 2016. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Ameer Meea! Page 121. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  On  page  121,  item  28222.012  -  Casting  of  Roof  Slab  Grant,  the 

amount  budgeted  is  Rs110  m.  and  in  the  note  it  is  mentioned  that  1,900  families  have 

benefitted from the Roof Slab Grant Scheme. But, as announced in the Budget, the limit has 

been increased from Rs10,000 to Rs20,000. Therefore, it means that less people will benefit 

from this grant. So, can I ask the Vice-Prime Minister, the fact that he has increased the limit 

and, at the same time, the amount that has been budgeted is the same, how many people will 

benefit from this scheme? 

Mr Soodhun: I don’t have the exact figure of how many people will benefit from the 

scheme, but I can tell  you that now the grant for the casting of roof slab has been increased 

from  Rs65,000  to  Rs75,000.  And  also,  the  income  previously  was  Rs8,500,  now  it  is 

Rs10,000. And families earning between Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 monthly are also eligible to a 

grant of Rs14,000. Increasing in the grant for the purchase of building materials Rs55,000 has 

increased  to  Rs65,000  for  the  family  earning  Rs10,000.  So,  now  for  the  payment  effected 

recently is as follows: January to 2015: 47.

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  My  question  is  that  now  the  limit  has  increased.  That  is  more 

people  will  be  eligible  for  this  scheme  and,  at  the  same  time,  the  Budget  has  remained  the 

same. So, my question is: how many people will benefit from this system being given that the 

limit has not increased. 

Mr Soodhun: Yes. 1,900 people. 

(Interruptions) 

Yes! 

 

 

The Chairperson: Hon. Mahomed! 

106 

Mr Mahomed: I have a few questions here…. 

Mr Soodhun: About 1,500. 

The Chairperson: One question! 

Mr Mahomed: One question only? 

The Chairperson: Yes, because of the time allocation. 

Mr Mahomed: Okay! For Casting of Roof Slab Grant,  I do agree that  you need to 

have a Budget per  year and for this year it is  going to be Rs110 m.  Let us say the Ministry 

exhausts that fund in three months’ time. The next batch of housing unit, do they need to wait 

for next year because many at times, their houses are inspected and there is a long delay for 

them to get their payment and this becomes a problem for them? How does it work? 

Mr  Soodhun:  In  fact,  if  we  go  to  the  previous  year,  we  have  granted  much  more 

than  what  has  been  granted  in  5  to  10  years.  But,  your  question  is,  if  it  happens  money  is 

exhausted … 

(Interruptions) 

I will go to the Minister of Finance again. I will go and talk to him that there is a list. Now, 

we  are  working  on  the  list.  I  cannot  just  tell  him  that  there  are  so  many  people.  We  are 

working on a list, if finally we need funds - because it is not the first time that we need - we 

will go to the Minister of Finance. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Quirin! 

Mr  Quirin:  Madam  Chairperson,  under  item  28222.017  -  Construction  of  Social 

Housing  Units.  An  amount  of  Rs812  m.  has  been  earmarked  for  the  construction  of  social 

housing units. Can we know the number of houses to be constructed region-wise, please? 

Mr  Soodhun:  As  I  said,  there  are  1,900  new  housing  units,  Phase  III,  Phase  IV. 

Also, now, we have the construction of 70 housing units at Henrietta and 48 service… 

(Interruptions) 

But  the  construction  of  567  housing  units  is  still  ongoing.  So,  91  housing  units  are  already 

under  construction  at  Sebastopol,  152  housing  units  at  Quatre  Cocos,  149  housing  units  at 

 

 

107 

Camp Ithier, 46 housing units at Beau Bois and 68 housing units at Chebel. This is what we 

have. 

(Interruptions) 

I can go on. We have 71 at Melrose, 72 at Mon Goût, 47 at Souillac, 86 at Khoyratty, 73 at 

Petit Bel Air and so on. We have a lot. 

(Interruptions) 

The  Chairperson:  Hon.  Soodhun,  if  you  have  got  a  long  list  like  that  for  other 

questions, then you may as well circulate it. 

Mr Soodhun:  I will give details, my time will go off. 

The Chairperson:  You circulate it, it’s much better. How Fowdar! 

Mr  Fowdar:  On  page  121,  item  25120.002  –  Subsidies  to  Financial  Public 

Corporations,  Subsidy  to  MHC  (Housing  Loans),  there  is  a  provision  of  Rs10  m.  annually. 

What  is  the  subsidy  for?  And  the  second  part  of  the  question  is:  MHC  is  a  very  profitable 

company; they are making more than Rs200 m.  profit per annum. Why  are we giving them 

subsidy? 

Mr Soodhun: Government provides subsidy to purchase housing unit to households 

earning  an  income  of  Rs8,500  per  month  to  reduce  their  monthly  repayment.  In  November 

1988, un plan épargne logement was launched and in order to boost up the scheme to attract 

investors, Government gave 3% interest on the basic rate. In September 2000, the Mauritius 

Housing  Co.  Ltd.  came  up  with  a  new  Housing  Deposit  Certificate  to  raise  funds.  It  was  a 

subsidy for the people who earn a salary of Rs8,500. 

(Interruptions) 

The  Chairperson:  No.  we  have  exceeded  the  time  allotted  already  by  20  minutes. 

So, can we move to page 122?  

(Interruptions) 

I will allow on page 121, hon. Barbier, because he has not had any question, then I will come 

to page 122. 

 

(Interruptions) 

 

108 

Mr Barbier: Thank you, Chair. On the question of social housing I can see that there 

is no provision as far as the replacement of asbestos housing units are concerned which were 

supposed to come this year. So, may I know from the hon. Vice-Prime Minister whether there 

is any provision, if it is not in this code, in which code it is? 

Mr  Soodhun:  A  very  good  question!  Thank  you,  Sir!  We  have  taken  into 

consideration  and  for  the  kind  information  of  my  colleague,  we  have  set  up  a  committee 

under  the  chairmanship  of  the  Minister  of  Environment  to  look  into  it  and  we  are  just 

building the new houses. We are also having discussions with the Minister of Finance to see 

how we can come with a solution to help. It is a very pertinent question. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  There  is  the  Secretary  National  Planning  and  Development 

Commission on page 122, is there a National Planning and Development Commission, and if 

so,  who  is  acting  as  the  Secretary  because  there  is  no  provision  for  the  post?  Item  21110  - 

Land Management and Physical Planning. 

Mr Soodhun: Action is being initiated to prescribe the scheme of service and fill the 

post very soon by the Survey Section. 

Mr Baloomoody: Who is acting as Secretary now? 

(Interruptions) 

Action will be taken to fill the post, but who is acting as Secretary now? 

Mr Soodhun: I am sure that the work is being done by other people. 

Mr Ameer Meea: Page 122 item .005 - Extra Assistance there is an amount of Rs5.2 

m. may we have the details of this amount? 

Mr Soodhun: Payment of salaries and allowances to the Indian officers, 1 Lieutenant 

Commander and 2 petty officers of the Hydrographic Unit. 

Mr Mahomed:  Item  2111.013 - LAVIMS.  LAVIMS  is  a project  that was completed 

some time ago and we see that in the last financial year there was no provision and suddenly 

as from this year and for the next three years a provision of Rs40 m. is being made annually. 

May we know what is it about? 

Mr Soodhun: The amount provided for this year is Rs40 m. The provision has been 

made for this year. 

 

(Interruptions) 

 

Maintenance of the hardware and software for one year. 

109 

Mr Jhuboo: Item 22130 concerning Studies and Surveys there is a provision of Rs14 

m. for 2016 and Rs20 m.  for the next year. Can we know from the hon. Vice-Prime Minister 

the type of surveys and studies that he is referring to? 

Mr  Soodhun:  Studies  and  surveys,  hydrographic  service  by  the  Indian  Navy.  A 

hydrographic  unit  has  been  established  at  the  Ministry  which  acts  as  a  nodal  agency 

responsible  for  providing  hydrographic  support  to  all  stakeholders  related  to  maritime 

domain. 

Mr Ameer Meea: Coming back to the LAVIMS Project, this project has cost almost 

Rs.1 billion and can I ask the hon. Vice-Prime Minister what is the percentage of completion 

of  this  project,  that  is,  in  terms  of  land  that  is  available  in  Mauritius,  be  it  private  land  or 

State-owned  land,  what  is  the  percentage  of  land  that  has  already  been  répertorié  sur  le 

système LAVIMS? 

Mr Soodhun: 60 per cent. 

Mr Uteem: Still on the LAVIMS Project, the project has a lot of delay and yet we are 

budgeting  Rs40  m.  in  maintenance.  So,  this  project  is  not  even  implemented  and  we  are 

budgeting  for  maintenance.  May  I  know  from  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  who  is  the 

consultant and whether we can look into the matter because we cannot pay for maintaining a 

system which is not working? 

Mr Soodhun: Yes, it is for an IT system for the maintenance support and it should be 

ongoing. We have already 60% … 

Mr  Bhagwan:  On  page  123,  item  26313.091  -  Town  and  Country  Planning  Board, 

there  is  an  increase.  Can  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  at  least  circulate  the  composition  of 

the board and when did the board meet last? 

Mr Soodhun: Yes, I am going to circulate. 

Mr Baloomoody: Under item 22130.003 - Land Use Planning and Management  (b) 

Review  of  National  Land  Development  Strategy  page  123,  we  are  budgeting  Rs10  m.  this 

year. May we know where matters stand with regard to that project? 

Mr Soodhun: Review of National  Land Development Strategy includes the drafting 

of the planning legislation and Rs28.5 m. has been earmarked for the review of national land 

development  strategy  in  2016-2017.  One  component  of  the  project  to  review  the  existing 

 

 

110 

planning  registration  has  already  started.  So  far,  Rs3.5  m.  has  been  spent  on  the  planning 

legislation consultancy involving only one consultant and the update of NLDS will consist of 

a  review  of  the  policies  and  land  management  practices  of  the  different  stakeholders.  It  is 

expected to start shortly. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  Is  this  project  being  carried  out  in-house  or  is  it  an  independent 

consultant and, if so, how this consultant was selected? 

Mr Soodhun: There is a specialist skilled team of professionals in various fields such 

as  transport  planning,  land  economist,  tourism  planning,  infrastructural  planning.  For  the 

infrastructural  planning  we  will  require  the  National  Land  Development  Strategy.  The 

consultancy of NLDS has been delayed as it is difficult to find appropriate specialists skilled 

locally to carry out the study. 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:  Item  22120  –  Fees,  Rs3.6  m.  It  has  increased  from  Rs1.3  m.  to 

Rs3.6 m. May we know why such an increase and also if we have the details of this amount? 

The Chairperson:  If it is a long piece of information, the hon. Vice-Prime Minister 

can circulate it. 

Mr Soodhun: It is the payment of fees to the members of the committees. For the Bid 

Evaluation  Committee,  Chairperson  gets  Rs600  per  sitting  to  a  maximum  of  Rs1,800  per 

evaluation;  the  Secretary,  Rs660  for  sitting  up  to  a  maximum  of  Rs1,100  per  evaluation; 

members,  Rs500  per  sitting  up  to  a  maximum  of  Rs1,500  per  sitting.    For  the  Board  of 

Assessment, it’s the Chairperson, the Secretary and Morcellement Board. 

Mr  Uteem:  Madam  Chairperson,  again  on  LAVIMS  Project,  item  31132.101  (e), 

Hardware  Replacement,  there  is  Rs63  m.  budgeted.    So,  may  I  know  from  the  hon.  Vice-

Prime  Minister  what  has  been  the  total  cost  of  LAVIMS  and  who  is  monitoring  the 

implementation?  Because it is not possible that we have to replace the hardware for Rs63 m. 

when the system has not even been implemented. 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: Only one question on page 124, and then we will move to the next 

page.  Hon. Members, I said right at the beginning that the Whips had agreed on the time to 

be allocated to each Ministry. We have already exceeded this by half an hour.  I think I have 

been flexible enough to exceed the time allotted to others. 

(Interruptions) 

 

 

111 

Hon. Ameer Meea, I am sorry, you cannot complain, because the Whips had agreed.  I have 

said right at the beginning that the two Whips had agreed, together with me, for time allotted 

for  each  Ministry.    I  have  been  flexible.    We  have  exceeded,  for  this  Ministry,  30  minutes 

already.  We have given 40 minutes already. 

Mr Soodhun:  The system is being implemented and the hardware has to be replaced 

and reviewed. We are collecting Rs82 m. 

Vote  4-1  Vice  Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Lands 

(Rs2,262,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote  5-1  Vice-Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Public  Utilities  was 

called. 

Mr Jugnauth: May I, Madam Chairperson, move for amendments to the Vote 5-1 of 

the  Vice-Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Public  Utilities  under  items 

32145.503,  Loan  to  Central  Water  Authority  and  32145.517,  Loan  to  Wastewater 

Management Authority as per amendment circulated. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  page  125,  Main  Achievements,  Pailles  Water  Treatment  Plant 

became operational, increasing daily water treatment capacity to 80,000m3. May I know what 

are the daily hours of water supply in the region of Pailles? 

Mr Collendavelloo:  They have increased almost 24 hours. So, it could be 22, 23. 

Mr  Uteem:  On  the  same  item  Pailles  Water  Treatment  Plant,  can  the  hon.  Vice-

Prime  Minister  confirm  that  Pailles  Water  Treatment  Plant  is  running  at  full  capacity  of 

80,000 m3? 

Mr Collendavelloo:  The answer is in the affirmative. 

Mr  Mahomed:  On  the  same  item  Main  Achievements,  one  can  read  that  59,231 

families have benefitted from lower electricity tariff through the introduction of a new social 

tariff, when the target on the next page is 70,000. All along, I understood it that beneficiaries 

will be eligible for the social tariff based on their monthly consumption.  So, why is  it that 

10,000 families have still not benefitted from that social tariff? 

Mr Collendavelloo: There is a fluctuation.  Our estimates were 70,000, but when you 

look  at  the  actual  situation  of  people,  there  are  not  as  many  people  who  are  socially 

disadvantaged as we thought that they were.  We still keep the limit of 70,000 in the unlikely 

event that poor people become poorer, but we do not think that this is going to happen. 

 

 

112 

What is also happening is that some people who are within that category do not know 

that they are in this category.  CEB has sent 8,000 letters.  We are awaiting reply to try and 

see whether other people can’t get in.  We will wait. 

Dr.  Joomaye:  In  the  Main  Achievements  concerning  renewable  energy,  there  is  an 

additional 9.35 MW.  Can we know to how much that brings the total quantum of renewable 

energy, including that 9.35 MW? 

Mr Collendavelloo: The total amount of all renewable energy, including hydro, sun, 

etc., is 20.3% of the total energy provided.  So, in terms of MW, it would be one fifth of 500, 

say 100 MW. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  On  the  same  page,  the  one  before  the  last  dot  –  Additional  2,153 

premises connected to  the sewerage network.  Can the hon. Vice-Prime Minister lay on the 

Table a list, area wise probably, of the inhabitants who have benefitted that connection? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  The  hon.  Member  will  recall  that  when  I  addressed  the  House 

last Friday, I tabled a list of all projects, which included all.  I know it is a bit complicated.  I 

can assist on individual questions.  But to table a list, may I just refer to that directory.  Yes, I 

can  compile  a  numerical  list  also.    It  is  not  a  difficult  thing  to  do.    It  is  mostly  in  Plaine 

Wilhems, Parisot and Verger Bissambar, which is well known to our friends of Constituency 

No. 20.  I don’t know whether it is on the document which the hon. Vice-Prime Minister laid 

on  the  Table  when  he  addressed  the  House,  but  with  regard  to  connection  of  additional 

premises to the sewerage network, I see that the target is for 2,000 premises.  Is there a list 

already worked out, area-wise, and if so, can we have the list? 

 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    You  are  referring  to  the  additional  2,153  premises?    The 

projects which are completed are Plaines Wilhems, Parisot, Verger Bissambar.  

(Interruptions) 

All right, I get it now.  Implementation of Plaines Wilhems project, Marcel Cabon, Cipailles 

Brûlé, Karo Lalo, Tranquebar, Highlands.  But to be more precise, the directory can assist or 

I can assist in whatever way you wish. 

 

 

The Chairperson:  Pages 126,  127, 128! 

Mr  Ameer  Mea:  On  page  128,  under  item  21110  –  Personal  Emoluments.  With 

regard to Deputy Director, Technical Services (Public Utilities), in 2016, the post is nil and 

for  2016/2017  it  should  be  one,  but,  at  the  same  time,  in  the  Estimates  nothing  has  been 

 

 

113 

budgeted.    So,  do  I  presume  that  for  this  post  the  Ministry  is  not  going  to  recruit  a  Deputy 

Director, Technical Services? 

 

Mr Collendavelloo: The post was advertised, but no candidate was eligible, so now 

the Ministry is reviewing the scheme of service to see how we can get somebody in. 

 

 

The Chairperson:  Page 128, no more questions?  Page 129!  Yes, hon. Bhagwan! 

Mr Bhagwan:  At page 129, item 26 Grants, under .98 – Utility Regulatory Authority 

where Rs5 m. is earmarked, can the hon. Vice-Prime Minister inform the House whether il a 

trouvé cet oiseau rare? 

 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    There  are  four  rare  birds  which  have  to  be  found.    We  have 

found  everyone,  but,  of  course,  with  due  deference  to  them,  I  would  not  like  to  give  their 

names  right  now;  they  have  all  agreed.  I  need  to  consult  the  Rt.  hon.  Prime  Minister,  of 

course, to seek his agreement and he will now continue with the process with the hon. Leader 

of the Opposition, etc. 

 

Mr Mahomed:  On that same item, budgetary provision of Rs5 m. has been made for 

the next three years for the operationalisation of the URA.  Now, this is an Authority and if I 

compare it with MARENA, which is an agency, the amount that is being budgeted is twice as 

much, Rs10 m.  So, my question is: is the hon. Vice-Prime Minister satisfied with the amount 

of Rs5 m. being sufficient for the running of an Authority? 

 

Mr Collendavelloo:  Of course, it’s not, but it is almost a token, then funds will be 

used  for  remuneration  and  we  will  find  ways  and  means.    For  the  moment,  the  Authority, 

when we got the Board, then we shall see how much actually the operation will cost.   

(Interuptions) 

Yes, exactly!  There is no need for them.  Exactly what I have said, maybe it will be reviewed 

as and when provisions are made. 

 

Mr Uteem:  At page 129, item 22030 – Rent, amount budgeted for next year is Rs4.8 

m.  and  then  there  is  nothing  budgeted  afterwards.    So,  do  I  take  it  that  afterwards  they  are 

going to acquire new premises or eventually leave? 

 

Mr Collendavelloo:   Let me reassure  you, I am  not going to be disbanded.  That is 

one  thing.  What  is  happening  is  that  we  are  going  to  move  to  new  offices  in  Ebene  and,  I 

think, the rent  is  going to be paid  by  some other Ministries.  There is  a technical  issue and 

this is why the rent is not forwarded for the next year.   

 

 

114 

 

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    At  page  129,  under  item  .005  –  Extra  Assistance.    There  is  an 

amount of Rs2.2 m. budgeted.  I presume it is the same as other Ministries; then, it would be 

funds that are paid to advisers and, if this is the case, may we have a list of such item and also 

the breakdown. 

 

Mr Collendavelloo:  You mean the advisers?   

(Interruptions) 

Yes, I have three advisers, Miss Boolakee, Mr D. Anacootee and Mr G. Tirvengadum. There 

will probably be a fourth one, but I am not yet settled on that. 

 

Mr  Baloomoody:  At  page  130,  under  item  22120  –  Fees.    Last  year,  we  budgeted 

Rs560,000  and  this  year  it  is  Rs3.6  m.    May  we  know  with  regard  to  what  these  fees  are 

attributed to and who are the beneficiaries? 

 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    I  will  just  read  what  I  have.    First  of  all,  there  is  Energy 

Efficiency  Technical  and  Sub-Committee.    That  is  Rs120,000.    Secondly,  the  Energy 

Efficiency Committee, which is Rs120,000, and we have the fees for the Chairman, which is 

Rs360,000.    Then  we  have  Consultancy  services  for  the  Energy  Efficiency  Management 

Office.  We will appoint a Consultant to conduct training on energy audits, including training 

on  boilers  and  refrigeration;  about  60  trainees  will  be  enlisted  and  will  undergo  an 

examination to be certified as Energy Auditors and be registered with the EEMO and that is 

Rs3 m.  That is how we reached that sum.  So, it is Rs3 m., the bulk of it is for the training of 

these Energy Auditors.  And, if I may add very briefly… 

(Interruptions) 

Yes, in my time, because I didn’t have time to talk about it during my speech on the Budget.  

It is very important to give a training to these people, to get to a target of 10% energy savings 

nationwide, and that is a lot of money. 

 

Mr  Mahomed:    My  question  pertains  to  item  22130.001  –  (e)  Consultancy  for  the 

adoption of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG).  The WarleyParsons Report of 2014 is clear in its 

recommendation, in that the use of  LNG in  Mauritius will only be commercially viable the 

day we start using LNG in buses, in cars and possibly in ships over and above an electricity 

production… 

 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Mohamed, is your question a matter of policy or..? 

 

 

115 

 

Mr  Mahomed:    We  are  going  to  spend  a  total  of  Rs50  m.  on  consultancy  over  the 

next two years. What does the consultancy seek to achieve? 

 

Mr Collendavelloo:   As a matter of policy, we have decided to study the possibilities 

of LNG in Mauritius.  For that purpose there is a technical committee which is sitting.  There 

is  a  Ministerial  Committee;  we  met.    I  think  we  are  three  or  four  Ministers.    Within  one 

meeting, we realised that was way out of our depth and we appointed a technical committee.  

Now, these Consultants will deal, first of all, with sources of supply.  As you know, there is a 

problem  with  Mozambique  right  now.  Secondly,  most  importantly,  mode  of  transport  from 

the source to the port, that is, to Port Louis.  Then how do we transport it?  And all this, the 

Consultants will have to examine and we’ll have to examine where we will reach it. The hon. 

Member  is  absolutely  right.    It  is  not  economically  viable  to  have  LNG  just  for  electricity.  

We  need  it  for  transport,  we  need  for  bunkering  and  we  need  it  eventually  for  piping  in 

towns.    So,  I  am  not  going  to  engage  the  State  into  a  huge  project  until  I  am  sure  that  the 

Consultants have given the Government the green light on this.  I hope I have been helpful on 

this. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Uteem! 

Mr Uteem: I am glad for the answer of the hon. Vice-Prime Minister, but may I know 

in  respect  of  this  consultancy  whether  Request  for  Proposal  has  already  been  launched 

because it has been a number of months that we are talking about it? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  I  think  they  have  been  launched  a  few  weeks  ago.  Yes,  they 

have.  They were launched a few weeks ago.  I have read a paper.  I was not too sure whether 

they had been launched by now, but I get many nods they have been launched. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Dr. Joomaye! 

Dr.  Joomaye:  Under  item  22900.099  (d)  Sensitisation  for  Energy  Efficiency  Audit 

(PNEE), a sum of Rs4 m. is being voted.  I would like to know if this will be carried out by 

the officers of the Ministry or would be subcontracted to private consultants. 

 Mr Collendavelloo: The contract has been awarded to PF Building on 26 May 2016 

for Rs5 m. over two years.  Am I right?  Yes.  This is a joint Government JEC/AFD initiative. 

We  are  trying  to  work  towards  this  energy  audit.    As  I  answered  to  hon.  Uteem,  this  is  a 

crucial part of our programme.  Unfortunately, I did not have time, during my speech, to talk 

about  it.    I  will  try  and  seek  another  opportunity  at  Statement  Time  to  say  what  is  our 

programme on this. 

 

 

116 

The Chairperson: Hon. Ameer Meea!  No question!  Hon. Osman Mahomed!  Please 

be brief, hon. Osman Mahomed! 

Mr Mahomed:  I shall try my level best. 

The Chairperson: No, but you have to be brief. 

Mr Mahomed: Under item 25110.008 Central Electricity Board, why are we giving 

a subsidy to CEB to the tune of Rs92 m. in a year when there was a lot of windfall gains on 

account of the falling prices of fossil fuel? Or rather why have we given?  

(Interruptions) 

Mr Collendavelloo:  In fact, there is no subsidy.  There used to be a subsidy which 

Government was given for Sarako project for the Landfill Gas to Energy and for the Plaines 

des Roches Windmill Project. And, again, the hon. Member is right, with the windfall gains 

on  the  petroleum  prices,  Government  has  slashed  our  subsidy  but  for  Mauritius  Housing  I 

hear  they  keep  on  giving,  they  are  also  profitable,  but  I  am  not  going  to  fight  with  my 

colleague, the Minister of Finance and Economic Development now. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Fowdar!  No!  Hon. Uteem! Page 131!  Hon. Uteem! 

Mr Uteem: Under item  311132.442 Upgrading  of Street  lighting along  Motorways, 

there is only a budgeted amount of Rs30 m. for next year.  May I know from the hon. Vice-

Prime  Minister  whether  it  is  going  to  be  only  a  one-off,  only  next  year  that  the  upgrading 

would fall under his Ministry, what happened after that? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  For  the  moment,  it  is  one-off.    What  happens  after  that,  we’ll 

have  to  see.    There  was  an  urgency  to  look  at  it  and  we  have  put  the  manpower  and  our 

knowledge.  Then, we will see, we will renew the contract; we will see what we’ll do. 

The Chairperson: Hon. Osman Mahomed! 

Mr Mahomed: On that same item where there has been cable theft, so replacing them 

will lead to the same problem.  Is consideration being given to systems which do not require 

electrical cables like solar PV? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  That  has  been  the  subject  of  a  long  discussion  between  hon. 

Bodha, myself, CEB, etc.  

(Interruptions) 

 

 

117 

The technical  people tell me solar cannot  be used for that purpose, we need to  use sodium.  

Now, underground cable, I just had a discussion with hon. Alain Wong, he says why are you 

putting  aerial  cables.    Again,  because  people  steal  cables  down!    We  have  to  give  light  to 

some motorways; we are doing the best that we can, the best is never good enough, of course. 

The  Chairperson:  I  draw  the  attention  of  hon.  Members  that  I  will  not  accept 

questions on policies.  Hon. Fowdar, yes! 

 

Mr Fowdar: On page 132. 

The Chairperson: 131! 

Mr Fowdar: No.  

Mr  Baloomoody:  There  is  a  sum  of  Rs30  m.  for  lighting  for  the  Highway  Project.  

You said  it is  one-off, what  about  the maintenance?  Does it include the maintenance  cost?  

Who will maintain it, the Ministry? 

Mr Collendavelloo: I think the overall idea is that we will ensure the maintenance.  Is 

that so?  Yes.  We will continue to ensure the maintenance, we shall see at what cost.   

The Chairperson:  Page 132!  Hon. Fowdar! 

Mr  Fowdar:  There  is  a  last  item  on  that  page  25110.009  Subsidy  to  Central  Water 

Authority, this time it is subsidy to CWA.  For the coming year, it is Rs16 m. and then it goes 

off.  Can we know the reason? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  The  payment  to  CWA  is  in  respect  of  the  supply  of  6  metre 

cubes of water free of charge being implemented since 01 January 2016.  52,000 households 

out of a total of 372,000 consumers benefit from this scheme.  For the subsequent years, the 

cost will be absorbed by CWA.   

Now, there was another  item,  there used to  be a  compensation of Rs209 m.    It  does 

not appear this year in the budget as no subsidy is being provided to CWA in respect of loss 

of  revenue  upon  abolition  of  levy  of  one  fifty  on  each  litre  of  locally  produced  soft  drink, 

bottled water and food drink. 

Let me just say ten seconds on policy because it is related to policy.  We will need to 

review  the  whole  financial  structure  of  CWA  and  I  will  come  forward  and  I  am  sure  there 

will be a debate in the House and in the public on the restructuration of CWA. 

The Chairperson:  Hon. Dr. Joomaye! 

 

 

118 

Dr. Joomaye: Under item 22130.005 (b) Dam break analysis, we find a sum of Rs15 

m.  voted  and  additional  30  m.  to  be  spent  over  the  next  two  years.    Has  the  contract  been 

allocated already?   

Mr Collendavelloo: The question is: who is the contractor?  Well, we need to do it.  I 

don’t think we have appointed the contractor yet.  No, we have not appointed the contractor 

yet.   

Mr Uteem: On the same item, may I know from the hon. Vice-Prime Minister when 

we talk about damn break analysis, are we talking about all the dams in Mauritius because it 

is only in singular.  So, are we going to do a general analysis of all the existing dams? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  If  I  may  give  the  list!  We  are  talking  of  Mare  aux  Vacoas, 

Midlands, la Ferme and Bagatelle which are the dams which need to be looked at. 

Mr Ameer Meea: On item 22030 – Rent, there is an amount of Rs4.3 m. budgeted, 

may  we  know  what  is  being  rented,  the  floor  space  area  and  where  this  building  is  being 

rented? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  That  is  for  the  Water  Resources  Unit  which  is  at  Royal 

Commercial  Complex  in  Rose  Hill.  The monthly  rental  is  Rs338,790  for 11784  square  feet 

plus Rs100,000 annually for parking.  

Mr Mahomed:  Under item  22130.005  (b) Dam  Break Analysis,  how does the hon. 

Vice-Prime Minister reconcile the fact that the Bagatelle Dam is going to be impounded this 

year with 14,000,000 m³ of water and, at the same time, we are doing a Dam Break Analysis? 

Is it safe? We are analysing the dam against breaking in a year where it is going to be fully 

impounded with 14,000,000 m³ of water. 

Mr Collendavelloo: I asked the question and I was told and I am confirmed that the 

analysis  will  be  carried  out  before  impounding  and  then  the  impounding  will  be  done 

gradually, I believe, just like you fill your bath you don’t fill it all at one go but gradually. I 

suppose they are technicians and they know what they are doing. 

Mr  Baloomoody:  With  regard  to  item  22060  -  Maintenance  of  which:  Other 

Structures  -  Dams,  may  we  know  which  dams  we  are  talking  about?  Rs6  m.    for  the 

maintenance? 

 

 

119 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  Is  the  hon.  Member  talking  of  maintenance  of  building  and 

vehicles?  

(Interruptions) 

No? Other structures – dams, yes, that is provision for, first of all, Midlands Dam. We need 

Rs1  m.  for  maintenance  of  electromechanical  equipment.  For  Mare  aux  Vacoas  and  La 

Ferme, we need Rs5 m. for hydro mechanical works on dams and feeder canals. Then there is 

the contract for Midlands Dam which has been awarded to Manser Saxon Contracting Ltd for 

a  duration  of  three  years  ending  April  2017.  The  contract  amount  is  Rs2,523,371  including 

VAT and 15% contingencies. Bids for Mare aux Vacoas to be launched in September 2016, 

cost estimate Rs4.5 m. Thank you. 

The Chairperson: Page 133, hon. Fowdar! 

Mr  Fowdar:  Item  32145.503  –  loan  to  Central  Water  Authority,  is  there  any  loan 

agreement, terms of loan, terms of repayment, interest rate? 

The  Chairperson:  If  the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  does  not  have  it  he  can  even 

circulate it later. 

Mr Collendavelloo:  I will.  I  am  afraid  I don’t have the terms and conditions  of the 

loan. I did not foresee that question. The hon. Member should have told me earlier… 

The  Chairperson:  The  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  can  still  circulate  it  later.  Hon. 

Uteem! 

Mr Uteem: Under 31113 - Construction of Dams (a) Bagatelle, there is a confusion 

as to when will Bagatelle Dam be operational because here there is an amount budgeted also 

for  2017/2018  and  2018/2019.  So,  may  we  have  some  clarification  as  to  when  will  the 

Bagatelle Dam be fully operational? 

Mr Collendavelloo:  It  will now be completed in December 2016  - this is why  I am 

waiting for confirmation - but it will be operational in July 2017. That is what I get. There is 

a lot of further information on this but I will wait. 

Mr  Mahomed:  My  question  relates  to  item  32145.503(a)  Pailles  Water  Treatment 

Plant,    the  hon.  Vice-Prime  Minister  just  mentioned  that  the  plant  is  fully  operational  with 

80,000 m³ per day. May I ask why are we investing another Rs90 m. in this year and another 

Rs15 m. in the next year? 

 

 

120 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  The  treatment  capacity  will  be  increased  up  to  a  maximum  of 

100,000  m3  per  day  and  this  will  allow  now  really  24  hours  and  not  almost  24  hours 

uninterrupted supply. The provision is for operations and maintenance work Rs20 m., release 

of retention money Rs64 m.  

Mr Ameer Meea: Coming back to Bagatelle Dam, the project value is Rs7.1 billion 

and  further  down  under  acquisition  of  financial  assets,    Loan  to  CWA  (b)  Bagatelle  Water 

Treatment  Plant  and  Associated  Works  Rs1,569,800,000.  I  presume  that  both  projects  are 

related. So, my question to the hon. Vice-Prime Minister is: what will be the total final cost of 

Bagatelle Dam including this Bagatelle Water Treatment Plant? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:  That  was  why  I  was  a  bit  surprised  that  I  was  not  getting 

questions.  The  dam,  itself,  is  a  storage  of  14  million  metre  cube.  It  started  with  an  initial 

project  value of Rs3.3 billion. That  was in  2011.  Let us not  go into  further detail. When in 

2013  they  discovered  that  the  initial  plan  was  not  good  and  that  they  had  to  have  a  cut-off 

wall  instead  of  a  grouting  so  the  contract  value  increased  and  it  came  to  Rs5.6  billion  plus 

VAT  which  came  to  Rs6.2  billion  from  Rs3.3  billion.  Then,  we  have  associated  costs  with 

that increase  and there has been litigation. We have had to  retain  lawyers and  all that. You 

know what lawyers are, they claim fees and… 

(Interruptions) 

You know that now!  

We  have  to  make  provisions  for  that.    All  these  have  increased  the  price,  but  I  am 

happy  to  say  that  on  this  aspect  of  litigation,  it  seems  we  are  heading  for  an  amicable 

settlement instead of costly litigation.  I hope it will materialise, I think so.  I, together with 

the Attorney General, we will report as and when. The total price now will be Rs8.5 billion 

for the dam and for the water treatment plant. For the water treatment plant, the negotiations 

for  the  contract  are  starting  at  the  end  of  August.  We  have  had  a  legal  battle.  Again,  legal 

battles take time.  We wasted one year in the Supreme Court instead of digging the hole for a 

water treatment plant. Finally, the contractor is there.  We are still threatened with litigation, 

we hope we can  go on.  We are starting the negotiations in August  and we hope to  finalise 

with hired consultant from South Africa, Orecon Ltd, to advise us and to supervise the work 

to  make  sure  that  there  is  no  increase  in  costs.    I  am  sorry  to  have  taken  more  time  than 

necessary.  

 

 

121 

Mr  Baloomoody:    On  the  same  page  133,  under  item  31113.011    Drilling  of 

Boreholes, a sum of Rs7 m. has been earmarked.  May we know exactly how many boreholes 

there are and where they are situated? 

 Mr Collendavelloo:  A contract was awarded in February 2016 to Sotravic Ltée for 

the  amount  of  Rs4.8  m.  for  drilling  of  boreholes  at  Mon  Desert  &  Mon  Tresor,  Mare  la 

Chaux  and  Beau  Plateau.  Works  have  been  completed  at  Mon  Desert  &  Mon  Tresor  and 

Mare la Chaux with a total yield of 2,400 meter cubes per day.  Works at Beau Plateau have 

been delayed because of a legal problem again. In 2015/2016, Rs2,229,000 have been spent 

in respect of boreholes drilled at Mon Desert & Mon Tresor and Mare la Chaux.   Then, there 

is also provision for a core hole at Mare Soulier, Mare aux Vacoas reservoir for investigation 

of stability of spillway.  The bids were floated in August with closing date at 06 September, 

2016 at an estimated cost of Rs1.5 m.  

The  Chairperson:    I  am  drawing  hon.  Members’  attention  to  the  fact  we  have 

exceeded  already  by  15  minutes,  the  time  allotted  and  agreed  by  the  Whips.    So,  can  I  ask 

hon. Members to be brief in their questions and then to be brief in their replies as well.  

Dr.  Joomaye:    Regarding  Bagatelle  Dam,  the  hon.  Minister  stated  that  the 

construction of the dam would be completed by the end of 2016 and he said as well that the 

construction of the treatment plant has not started yet.  Since we see that money is budgeted 

up till 2018 and 2019, can we know when the treatment plant will start to be operational? 

Mr Collendavelloo:  Well, we would have wanted the treatment plant to progress at 

the same time as the Bagatelle Dam.  We think we are just ahead of schedule that legal battle 

in the Supreme Court has made us waste a lot of time, but now we will start negotiations, in a 

dream  world  we  hope  that  we  would  finish  in  July  2017  so  that  the  two  are  operational 

together, but to say frankly, I don’t think that will be the case.  We are all doubtful as to this.  

Mr  Baloomoody:    On  page  134,  under  item  32145.517  Loan  to  Wastewater 

Management Authority,  can  I  ask the hon.  Vice-Prime Minister with  regard to  the  Bain  des 

Dames Sewerage Project and the Kensington Sewerage Project, where matters stand? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    For  the  Bain  des  Dames  Sewerage  Project,  the  consultant  is 

Servansingh Jadav & Partners who is appointed for a sum of Rs2.5 m. in 2012.  They have 

already submitted the preliminary design.  The work is scheduled to be implemented in 2018, 

provisions are earmarked in 2018-2019 as we see on the right-hand column, Rs130 m.  The 

cost estimated is, in fact, Rs175 m. including VAT, but the planned sum is Rs130 m.   

 

 

122 

For  the  Kensington  Sewerage  Project,  it  will  comprise  100  house  connections 

estimated  to  cost  Rs80  m.    The  tentative  starting  date  is  February  2017  with  an  expected 

completion date of September, 2018. 

Mr  Uteem:    Madam  Chairperson,  in  respect  to  Tranquebar/Vallée  des  Prêtres 

Sewerage Project  -  I have asked this question several  times  and  I  am  asking it again  - how 

much  money  is  earmarked  for  Tranquebar  because  Tranquebar  and  Vallée  des  Prêtres  are 

very  far  apart?    The  sum  of  R80,000  which  is  earmarked,  is  that  for  Tranquebar  or  for 

Tranquebar and Vallée des Prêtres? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    By  the  time  the  paper  comes,  let  me  just  say  one  thing.    The 

Cipailles Brûlé contract was awarded to Padayachee Contractor for RS76,543, 145.  Then, we 

have  Carreau  Lalo,  tender  to  be  launched  by  the  end  of  2016  and  Tranquebar,  tender  to  be 

launched  in  2017.    So,  we  need  to  launch  the  tenders  before  having  the  final  prices.    The 

estimates are as per stated here.  

Mr Uteem:    On page 136, item 31112.001 Construction of building Rs25 m., may I 

know  from  the  Vice-Prime  Minister  where  would  be  the  building  located  and  whether  the 

contract has already been awarded? 

Mr  Collendavelloo:    The  one  in  Helvetia  Saint  Pierre,  area  650  sq  metres,  big 

documents would be ready by the end of November, 2016 and tendering up to February 2017. 

The  expected  completion  date  of  the  building  is  February  2018.    The  building  will  be 

equipped with solar panels and rainwater harvesting.  

Vote  5-1  Vice-Prime  Minister’s  Office,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Public  Utilities 

(Rs2,947,000,000) was, on question put, agreed to. 

Vote 6-1 Finance and Economic Development was called. 

Mr Baloomoody:   On page 138. Major Achievements, the Board of Investment  has 

issued letters of intent for two projects under the ‘Smart City’ scheme.  May we know which 

projects they are and when construction will start? 

The  Chairperson:    The  Board  of  Investment  has  issued  letters  of  intent  for  two 

projects under ‘Smart City Scheme’; which two projects? 

Mr Jugnauth:  Can we wait for the information? 

The Chairperson:  Can we pass on to the next question in the meantime!   

 

 

123 

Mr  Baloomoody:    Pending  the  reply,  on  the  same  page  138,  some  40  NGOs 

benefitted  from  grants  under  the  decentralised  cooperation  Programme  and  around  300 

NGOs were empowered through training and awareness programme under the DCP & CSR 

to support effectively the poor and needy.  May we have a list of these NGOs who benefitted 

from grants and the 300 NGOs which were empowered through training? 

Mr Jugnauth:  I can circulate this later on. 

The Chairperson: We move to page 139 pending the reply.  Yes, we are still waiting 

for the reply.   

Mr  Uteem:    May  I  know  from  the  hon.  Minister  of  Finance  and  Economic 

Development - there is an item Attorney-at-Law, but no amount is budgeted – whether there 

is an intention of recruiting an Attorney-at-Law? 

Mr  Jugnauth:    In  fact,  Mr  Chairperson,  we  have  a  very  –  I  will  call  him  – 

outstanding  competent  officer,  Mr  Oozeer  who  has  been  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and 

Economic Development for so many years and he is a knowledgeable person in tax matters.  

Unfortunately, with age, now he has given us in a way some kind of notice that he would be 

leaving at some point in time.  Unfortunately, we have not had somebody to be trained to take 

up  this  position  and  we believe  that  a  lawyer  -  it  can  be  an  attorney,  it  can  be  a  barrister  – 

would be a suitable person, if we can recruit one.  In fact, we should not recruit only one. We 

should  recruit  two,  so  that  in  case  one  is  not  available,  the  other  one  will  be  available  to 

advise and to work with the SLO in terms of tax matters.   

The two Smart Cities are Omnicane and Médine. 

Mr  Baloomoody:    We  find  the  post  of  Financial  Management  Officer,  again  no 

provision was made and no provision has been made.  May we know what is the status of that 

post? 

Mr Jugnauth: I see it is a blank here.  The PRB report of 2013 has recommended the 

creation  of  a  new  grade  of  Financial  Management  Officer  to  be  filled  by  selection  from 

among  degree  holders  in  the  Financial  Operations,  Internal  Control  and  Procurement  and 

Supply Cadres.  This  Ministry is  currently sponsoring interested officers in  the three cadres 

for appropriate degree programmes.  Once a reasonable number of officers are qualified, the 

post will be filled in the context of professionalisation of the three cadres. 

 

 

124 

Mr Uteem:  On the same page, Principal Financial Operations Officer, the number 

budgeted  is  rising  from  2  to  71.    May  I  know  from  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Economic 

Development what exactly these Principal Financial Operations Officers do? 

Mr  Jugnauth:  The  post  for  Senior  Financial  Operations  Officer  which  was  made 

evanescent  in  the  PRB  report  2013  is  being  re-instated  and  restyled  Principal  Financial 

Operations  Officer  following  PRB  report  2016.    The  required  number  of  positions  in 

Ministries  and  Departments  is  being  provided  to  take  charge  of  small  units  in  Finance 

Sections and assist in the implementation of the HRMIS project and E-budget.  The number 

of posts per Ministry and Department would be reflected in the next budget upon finalisation 

of the Scheme of Service.  

Mr  Ameer  Meea:    On  page  142,  item  21110.005  Extra  Assistance.    There  is  an 

amount of Rs14.4 m. I presume in this figure are the salaries of advisers to the Minister.  So, 

may we have the details and a breakdown and the names to this figure? 

Mr  Jugnauth:    The  provisions  made  for  payment  of  salaries  to  eight  advisers  on 

contract inclusive of the Commissioner for the Protection of Borrowers as detailed.  

Name of advisers

(viii)  Mr R. K. Veeramundar 

Mr  Baloomoody:    On  the  same  page,  with  regard  to  the  Assessment  Review 

Committee, I see that there is no provision made for the year 2016/2017.  May we know what 

is the fate of this Assessment Review Committee? 

Mr  Jugnauth:  Provision  is  now  shown  under  Sub-Head  06-104.    The  Assessment 

Review Committee will still be here. 

 

 

125 

Mr Ameer Meea:  On page 142, item  no.  21110.004, Allowances, Rs20 m.  May we 

know the details of this amount? 

Mr  Jugnauth:    Provision  is  made  for  the  payment  of  ad-hoc,  responsibility  duty, 

entertainment  allowances  and  also  allowances  in  lieu  of  duty  remission  on  car  to  eligible 

staff.  I have a series here and to save the time of the House, I can circulate that. 

Mr Baloomoody:  Item 22120 - Fees, I find an increase of Rs6 m. compared to last 

year.  It was Rs12 m., now it is Rs18 m. and it will be Rs18 m. each year May we know the 

reason for that substantial increase? 

Mr  Jugnauth:  This  is  fees  to  the  Chairperson  and  members  of  Boards  and 

Committees.    These  are  provisions  made  for  payment  for  those  attending  the  following 

Committees – 

(a) 

Public Pension Advisory Committee; 

(b) 

The Sub-Committee on borrowing requirements of Government held at BoM; 

(c) 

Departmental Bid and Bid Evaluation Committees. 

There are also fees for training, that is, payment of fees to UTM, for officers of the financial 

operations,  procurement  and  supply  and  internal  control  cadres  who  are  following  the 

Diploma  BSc  courses  and  also  to  meet  local  training  for  other  staffs.  The  list  is  a  bit  long, 

Madam  Chairperson.  The  fees  to  consultants;  there  are  provisions  that  are  made  for 

consultancy  fees  in  relation  to  the  upgrading  of  the  parastatal  information  management 

system, refund of subscription fees to professional bodies in line with the recommendations 

of  the  PRB  Report  2016.  There  are  provisions  also  made  in  relation  to  procurement  of 

technical expertise, both locally and abroad, where specialised skills are required. There are 

also provisions shown under vote 28-1 Centrally Managed Initiatives of Government. 

Mr Uteem: Item 22900.956, Expenses icw with Public Sector Efficiency Bureau. May 

I know from the hon. Minister what this Public Sector Efficiency Bureau relates to? 

Mr  Jugnauth:  This  is  a  unit  which  had  existed  at  the  level  of  the  Ministry  of 

Financial Services, but which has been renamed as Public Sector Efficiency Bureau and that 

will be at the Ministry of Finance. But the object of that Bureau and scheme that is being set 

up and so on, I can circulate, because it is quite long. 

Mr Jhuboo: Item 28212.019,  DCP for Socio Economic Empowerment. I see there is 

a provision of Rs36 m. for 2015 and no provision for 2016. Can we have the details of that? 

 

 

126 

Mr  Jugnauth:  I  am  informed  that  it  has  been  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Social 

Integration and Economic Empowerment. 

Mr Ameer Meea:  The last item 28217, Other- Rs600,000. May we know what this 

is? 

Mr  Jugnauth:  Other  expense,  not  elsewhere  specified.  Insurance:  the  provision 

required for payment of insurance cover for experts and advisers serving under the bilateral 

cooperation  and  provision  for  insurance  cover  for  officers  proceeding  on  overseas  mission 

training. 

Dr.  Joomaye:  Item  26313.004,  Board  of  Investment.  There  has  been  a  very 

substantive increase of the budget from Rs198 m. to Rs266 m. and then it stabilises over the 

next  two  years.  Can  we  know  if  there  will  be  a  restructuration  of  the  Board  of  Investment 

justifying this increase of budgeting? 

Mr Jugnauth: The provision is made for the acquisition of IT equipment, purchase of 

access points router and switches and server. There is also acquisition of software for the e-

licensing platform. I will summarise; the purchase of additional server storage for backup and 

file sharing purpose. 

(Interruptions) 

The Chairperson: Item 26313.004, Board of Investment.

chairperson and the assessors.  

Mr Jugnauth:  Well, I am told this is under another subhead, but I have the list of all 

the  names  of  the  members,  their  designation  and  their  monthly  fees  that  are  payable.  I  can 

circulate that. 

Mr Ameer Meea: At page 145, under item 22120 –Fees, there is an amount of Rs4.8

incorporated in 2006, the Central Tender Board Act which provided for the setting up of the 

ex-CTB,  a  Government  body,  was  repealed.  However,  no  transitional  provisions  had  been 

made  in  the  enactment  for  the  staff  of  the  ex-Central  Tender  Board  to  be  transferred  to  the 

Central  Procurement  Board.  Therefore,  a  new  grade  of  Deputy  Chief  Executive  has  been 

created  to  enable  the  integration  of  the  Deputy  Secretary,  Central  Tender  Board,  in  post  in 

structure at the Central Procurement Board.

absorption of the Deputy Secretary of the former Central Tender Board in the new structure 

of the Central Procurement Board. 

The Chairperson: Yes, last two questions on this page! Hon. Baloomoody!

are we spending so much money to maintain those rental premises?

up-keeping of office building and toilets. I suppose there must be some adjustment that they
